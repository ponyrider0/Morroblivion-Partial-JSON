His son Pelagius Septim II was made emperor, and he faced a greatly depleted treasury, thanks to his father's poor management.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAs the new Queen of Solitude, Potema faced opposition from the old Nordic houses, who viewed her as an outsider.  Mantiarco had been widowed, and his former queen was loved.  She had left him a son, Prince Bathorgh, who was two years older than his stepmother, and loved her not.  But the king loved his queen, and suffered with her through miscarriage after miscarriage, until her 29th year, when she bore him a son.<BR>\r\n\r\n<BR>\r\n3E 97<BR>\r\n\u201cYou must do something to help the pain!\u201d Potema cried, baring her teeth.  The healer Kelmeth immediately thought of a she-wolf in labor, but he put the image from his mind.  Her enemies called her the Wolf Queen for certes, but not because of any physical resemblance.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cYour Majesty, there is no injury for me to heal.  The pain you feel is natural and helpful for the birth,\u201d he was going to add more words of consolation, but he had to break off to duck the mirror she flung at him.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cI'm not a pignosed peasant girl!\u201d She snarled, \u201cI am the Queen of Solitude, daughter of the Emperor!  Summon the daedra!  I'll trade the soul of every last subject of mine for a little comfort!\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cMy Lady,\u201d said the healer nervously, drawing the curtains and blotting out the cold morning sun. \u201cIt is not wise to make such offers even in jest.  The eyes of Oblivion are forever watching for just such a rash interjection.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cWhat would you know of Oblivion, healer?\u201d she growled, but her voice was calmer, quieter.  The pain had relaxed.  \u201cWould you fetch me that mirror I hurled at you?\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cAre you going to throw it again, your Majesty?\u201d said the healer with a taut smile, obeying her.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cVery likely,\u201d she said, looking at her reflection. \u201cAnd next time I won't miss.  But I do look a fright.  Is Lord Vhokken still waiting for me in the hall?\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cYes, your Majesty.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cWell, tell him I just need to fix my hair and I'll be with him.  And leave us.  I'll howl for you when the pain returns.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cYes, your Majesty.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nA few minutes later, Lord Vhokken was shown into the chamber.  He was an enormous bald man whose friends and enemies called Mount Vhokken, and when he spoke it was with the low grumble of thunder.  The Queen was one of the very few people Vhokken knew who was not the least bit intimidated by him, and he offered her a smile.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cMy queen, how are you feeling?\u201d he asked.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cDamned.  But you're looking like Springtide has come to Mount Vhokken.  I take it from your merry disposition that you've been made warchief.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cOnly temporarily, while your husband the King investigates whether there is evidence behind the rumors of treason on the part of my predecessor Lord Thone.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cIf you've planted it as I've instructed, he'll find it,\u201d Potema smiled, propping herself up in the bed. \u201cTell me, is Prince Bathorgh still in the city?\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cWhat a question, your highness,\u201d laughed the mountain. \u201cIt's the Tournament of Stamina today, you know the prince would never miss that.  The fellow invents new strategies of self-defense every year to show off during the games.  Don't you recall last year, where he entered the ring unarmored and after twenty minutes of fending off six bladesmen, left the games without a scratch?  He dedicated that bout to his late mother, Queen Amodetha.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cYes, I recall.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cHe's no friend to me or you, your highness, but you must give the man his due respect. He moves like lightning.  You wouldn't think it of him, but he always seems to use his awkwardness to his advantage, to throw his opponents off.  Some say he learned the style from the orcs to the south.  They say he learned from them how to anticipate a foe's attack by some sort of supernatural power.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cThere's nothing supernatural about it,\u201d said the Queen, quietly. \u201cHe gets it from his father.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cMantiarco never moved like that,\u201d Vhokken chuckled.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cI never said he did,\u201d said Potema.  Her eyes closed and her teeth gritted together. \u201cThe pain's returning.  You must fetch the healer, but first, I must ask you one other thing -- has the new summer palace construction begun?\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cI think so, your Highness.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cDo not think!\u201d she cried, gripping the sheets, biting her lips so a stream of blood dripped down her chin. \u201cDo!  Make certain that the construction begins at once, today!  Your future, my future, and the future of this child depend on it!  Go!\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nFour hours later, King Mantiarco entered the room to see his son.  His queen smiled weakly as he gave her a kiss on the forehead.  When she handed him the child, a tear ran down his face.  Another one quickly followed, and then another.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cMy Lord,\u201d she said fondly. \u201cI know you're sentimental, but really!\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cIt's not only the child, though he is beautiful, with all the fair features of his mother,\u201d Mantiarco turned to his wife, sadly, his aged features twisted in agony. \u201cMy dear wife, there is trouble at the palace.  In truth, this birth is the only thing that keeps this day from being the darkest in my reign.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cWhat is it?  Something at the tournament?\u201d Potema pulled herself up in bed. \u201cSomething with Bathorgh?\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cNo, it isn't the tournament, but it does relate to Bathorgh.  I shouldn't worry you at a time like this.  You need your rest.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cMy husband, tell me!\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cI wanted to surprise you with a gift after the birth of our child, so I had the old summer palace completely renovated.  It's a beautiful place, or at least it was.  I thought you might like it.  Truth to tell, it was Lord Vhokken idea.  It used to be Amodetha's favorite place.\u201d  Bitterness crept into the king's voice. \u201cNow I've learned why.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cWhat have you learned?\u201d asked Potema quietly.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cAmodetha deceived me there, with my trusted warchief, Lord Thone.  There were letters between them, the most perverse things you've ever read.  And that's not the worst of it.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cNo?\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cThe dates on the letters correspond with the time of Bathorgh's birth.  The boy I raised and loved as a son,\u201d Mantiarco's voice choked up with emotion. \u201cHe was Thone's child, not mine.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cMy darling,\u201d said Potema, almost feeling sorry for the old man.  She wrapped her arms around his neck, as he heaved his sobs down on her and their child.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cHenceforth,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cBathorgh is no longer my heir.  He will be banished from the kingdom.  This child you have borne me today will grow to rule Solitude.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cAnd perhaps more,\u201d said Potema. \u201cHe is the Emperor's grandson as well.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cWe will name him Mantiarco the Second.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cMy darling, I would love that,\u201d said Potema, kissing the king's tear-streaked face. \u201cBut may I suggest Uriel, after my grandfather the Emperor, who brought us together in marriage?\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nKing Mantiarco smiled at his wife and nodded his head.  There was a knock at the door.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cMy liege,\u201d said Mount Vhokken. \u201cHis highness Prince Bathorgh has finished the tournament and awaits you to present his award.  He has successfully withstood attacks by nine archers and the giant scorpion we brought in from Hammerfell.  The crowd is roaring his name.  They are calling him The Man Who Cannot Be Hit.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cI will see him,\u201d said King Mantiarco sadly, and left the chamber.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cOh he can be hit, all right,\u201d said Potema wearily. \u201cBut it does take some doing.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n",
