Ald Iuval and its sister city on the other side of the lake Ald Malak were strategically important fortresses.  He had been expecting a move against them for some time.  His captain pulled down a map of southwestern Morrowind from the wall and smoothed it out, fighting a gentle summer sea breeze wafting in from the open window.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cThey were heavily armored, you say?\u201d asked the captain.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cYes, sir,\u201d said Cassyr. \u201cThey were camped out near Bethal Gray in the Heartland, and I saw nothing but Ebony, Dwarven, and Daedric armor, fine weaponry, and siege equipment.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cHow about spellcasters and boats?\u201d asked Vivec.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cA horde of battlemages,\u201d replied Cassyr. \u201cBut no boats.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cAs heavily armored as they are, it will take them at least two weeks, like you said, to get from Bethal Gray to Lake Coronati,\u201d Vivec studied the map carefully. \u201cThey'd be dragged down in the bogs if they then tried to circle around to Ald Marak from the north, so they must be planning to cross the straits here and take Ald Iuval.  Then they'd proceed around the lake to the east and take Ald Marak from the south.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cThey'll be vulnerable along the straits,\u201d said the captain. \u201cProvided we strike when they are more than halfway across and can't retreat back to the Heartland.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cYour intelligence has once again served us well,\u201d said Vivec, smiling to Cassyr. \u201cWe will beat back the Imperial aggressors yet again.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n3 Mid Year, 2920<BR>\r\nBethal Gray, Cyrodiil<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cWill you be returning back this way after your victory?\u201d asked Lord Bethal.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nPrince Juilek barely paid the man any attention.  He was focused on the army packing its camp. It was a cool morning in the forest, but there were no clouds.  All the makings of a hot afternoon march, particularly in such heavy armor.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cIf we return shortly, it will be because of defeat,\u201d said the Prince.  He could see down in the meadow, the Potentate Versidue-Shaie paying his lordship's steward for the use of the village's food, wine, and whores.  An army was an expensive thing, for certes.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cMy Prince,\u201d said Lord Bethal with concern. \u201cIs your army beginning a march due east?  That will just lead you to the shores of Lake Coronati.  You'll want to go south-east to get to the straits.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cYou just make certain your merchants get their share of our gold,\u201d said the Prince with a grin. \u201cLet me worry about my army's direction.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n16 Mid Year, 2920<BR>\r\nLake Coronati, Morrowind<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nVivec stared across the blue expanse of the lake, seeing his reflection and the reflection of his army in the cool blue waters.  What he did not see was the Imperial Army's reflection.  They must have reached the straits by now, barring any mishaps in the forest.  Tall feather-thin lake trees blocked much of his view of the straits, but an army, particularly one clan in slow-moving heavy armor could not move invisibly, silently.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cLet me see the map again,\u201d he called to his captain. \u201cIs there no other way they could approach?\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cWe have sentries posted in the swamps to the north in case they're fool enough to go there and be bogged under,\u201d said the captain. \u201cWe would at least hear about it.  But there is no other way across the lake except through the straits.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nVivec looked down again at his reflection, which seemed to be distorting his image, mocking him.  Then he looked back on the map.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cSpy,\u201d said Vivec, calling Cassyr over. \u201cWhen you said the army had a horde of battlemages, what made you so certain they were battlemages?\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cThey were wearing gray robes with mystical insignia on them,\u201d explained Cassyr. \u201cI figured they were mages, and why else would such a vast number travel with the army?  They couldn't have all been healers.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cYou fool!\u201d roared Vivec. \u201cThey're mystics schooled in the art of Alteration.  They've cast a spell of water breathing on the entire army.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nVivec ran to a new vantage point where he could see the north.  Across the lake, though it was but a small shadow on the horizon, they could see gouts of flame from the assault on Ald Marak.  Vivec bellowed with fury and his captain got to work at once redirecting the army to circle the lake and defend the castle.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cReturn to Dwynnen,\u201d said Vivec flatly to Cassyr before he rode off to join the battle. \u201cYour services are no longer needed nor wanted.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nIt was already too late when the Morrowind army neared Ald Marak.  It had been taken by the Imperial Army.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n19 Mid Year, 2920<BR>\r\nThe Imperial City, Cyrodiil<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Potentate arrived in the Imperial City amid great fanfare, the streets lined with men and women cheering him as the symbol of the taking of Ald Marak.  Truth be told, a greater number would have turned out had the Prince returned, and the Versidue-Shaie knew it.  Still, it pleased him to no end.  Never before had citizens of Tamriel cheered the arrival of an Akaviri into their land.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Emperor Reman III greeted him with a warm embrace, and then tore into the letter he had brought from the Prince.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cI don't understand,\u201d he said at last, still joyous but equally confused. \u201cYou went under the lake?\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cAld Marak is a very well-fortified fortress,\u201d explained the Potentate. \u201cAs, I might add, the army of Morrowind has rediscovered, now that they are on the outside.  To take it, we had to attack by surprise and with our soldiery in the sturdiest of armor.  By casting the spell that allowed us to breathe underwater, we were able to travel faster than Vivec would have guessed, the weight of the armor made less by the aquatic surroundings, and attack from the waterbound west side of the fortress where their defenses were at their weakest.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cBrilliant!\u201d the Emperor crowed. \u201cYou are a wonderous tactician, Versidue-Shaie!  If your fathers had been as good at this as you are, Tamriel would be Akaviri domain!\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Potentate had not planned to take credit for Prince Juilek's design, but on the Emperor's reference to his people's fiasco of an invasion two hundred and sixteen years ago, he made up his mind.  He smiled modestly and soaked up the praise.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n21 Mid Year, 2920<BR>\r\nAld Marak, Morrowind<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSavirien-Chorak slithered to the wall and watched through the arrow slit the Morrowind army retreating back to the forestland between the swamps and the castle grounds.  It seemed like the idea opportunity to strike.  Perhaps the forests could be burned and the army within them.  Perhaps with Vivec in their enemies' hands, the army would allow them possession of Ald Iuval as well.  He suggested these ideas to the Prince.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cWhat you seem to be forgetting,\u201d laughed Prince Juilek. \u201cIs that I gave my word that no harm to the army or to their commanders during the truce negotiations.  Do you not have honor during warfare on Akavir?\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cMy Prince, I was born here in Tamriel, I have never been to my people's home,\u201d replied the snake man. \u201cBut even so, your ways are strange to me.  You expected no quarter and I gave you none when we fought in the Imperial Arena five months ago.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cThat was a game,\u201d replied the Prince, before nodding to his steward to let the Dunmer battle chief in.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nJuilek had never seen Vivec before, but he had heard he was a living god.  What came before him was but a man.  A powerfully built man, handsome, with an intelligent face, but a man nonetheless.  The Prince was pleased: a man he could speak with, but not a god.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cGreetings, my worthy adversary,\u201d said Vivec. \u201cWe seem to be at an impasse.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cNot necessarily,\u201d said the Prince. \u201cYou don't want to give us Morrowind, and I can't fault you for that.  But I must have your coastline to protect the Empire from overseas aggressions, and certain key strategic border castles, such as this one, as well as Ald Umbeil, Tel Aruhn, Ald Lambasi, and Tel Mothrivra.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cAnd in return?\u201d asked Vivec.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cIn return?\u201d laughed Savirien-Chorak. \u201cYou forget we are the victors here, not you.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cIn return,\u201d said Prince Juilek carefully. \u201cThere will be no Imperial attacks on Morrowind, unless in return to an attack by you.  You will be protected from invaders by the Imperial navy.  And your land may expand by taking certain estates in Black Marsh, whichever you choose, provided they are not needed by the Empire.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cA reasonable offer,\u201d said Vivec after a pause.  \u201cYou must forgive me, I am unused to Cyrodiils who offer something in return for what they take.  May I have a few days to decide?\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cWe will meet again in a week's time,\u201d said the Prince, smiling. \u201cIn the meantime, if your army provokes no attacks on mine, we are at peace.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nVivec left the Prince's chamber, feeling that Almalexia was right.  The war was at an end.  This Prince would make an excellent Emperor.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Year is Continued in Sun's Height.<BR>\r\n",
