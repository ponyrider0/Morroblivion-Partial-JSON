Please, simply consent to speak to me. Just a word, a moment with you, would ease my soul. If I cannot be with you, I will have to resort to something drastic.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nPlease, consider your feelings. Your husband is a lout, away for weeks at a time, with no consideration for your needs. I have always been there for you, and I always will be. We should be together, dear Risi.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRH\r\n<BR>\r\n",
