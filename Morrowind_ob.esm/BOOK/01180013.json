Proseccus, a nightblade in the service of the Empire, arrived at Lord Strale's house in disguise.  She was an apt pupil, and within days, he had taught what she needed to know.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cIt is a simple charm, not the sort of spell that could turn a raging daedroth into a love-struck puppy,\u201d said Proseccus. \u201cIf you do or say anything that would normally anger or offend your target, the power will weaken.  It will alter temporarily his perception of you, as spells of the school of illusion do, but his feelings of respect and admiration for you must be supported by means of a charm of a less magickal nature.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cI understand,\u201d smiled Gyna, thanking her tutor for the two spells of illusion he had taught her.  The time had come to use her new-found skill.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Prostitutes Guildhouse of Camlorn was a great palace in an affluent northern quarter of the city.  Prince Sylon could have found his way there blindfolded, or blind drunk as he often was.  Tonight, however, he was only lightly inebriated and he resolved to drink no more.  Tonight he was in the mood for pleasure.  His kind of pleasure.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cWhere is my favorite, Grigia?\u201d he demanded of the Guildmistress upon entering.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cShe is still healing from your appointment with her last week,\u201d she smiled serenely. \u201cMost of the other women are in with clients as well, but I saved a special treat for you.  A new girl.  One you will certainly enjoy.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Prince was guided to a sumptuously decorated suite of velvet and silk.  As he entered, Gyna stepped from behind a screen and cast her spell quickly, with her mind open to belief as Proseccus had instructed.  It was hard to tell if it worked at first.  The Prince looked at her with a cruel smile and then, like sun breaking through clouds, the cruelty left.  She could tell he was hers. He asked her her name.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cI am between names right now,\u201d she teased. \u201cI've never made love to a real prince before.  I've never even been inside a palace.  Is yours very ... big?\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cIt's not mine yet,\u201d he shrugged. \u201cBut someday I'll be king.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cIt would be wonderful to live in such a place,\u201d Gyna cooed. \u201cA thousand years of history.  Everything must be so old and beautiful.  The paintings and books and statues and tapestries.  Does your family hold onto all their old treasures?\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cYes, hoarded away with a lot of boring old junk in the archive rooms in the vaults.  Please, may I see you naked now?\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cFirst a little conversation, though you may feel free to disrobe whenever you like,\u201d said Gyna. \u201cI had heard there was an archive room, but it's quite hidden away.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cThere's a false wall behind the family crypt,\u201d said the Prince, gripping her wrist and pulling her towards him for a kiss.  Something in his eyes had changed.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cYour Highness, you're hurting my arm,\u201d Gyna cried.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cEnough talk, you bewitching whore,\u201d he snarled.  Holding back a sharp jab of fear, Gyna let her mind cool and perceptions whirl.  As his angry mouth touched her lips, she cast the second spell she had learned her illusionist mentor.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Prince felt his flesh turn to stone.  He remained frozen, watching Gyna pull together her clothing and leave the room.  The paralysis would only last for a few more minutes, but it was all the time she needed.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Guildmistress had already left with all her girls, just as Gyna and Lord Strale had told her to.  They would tell her when it was safe to return.  She had not even accepted any gold for her part in the trap.  She said it was enough that her girls would not be tortured anymore by that most perverse and cruel Prince.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cWhat a terrible boy,\u201d thought Gyna as she raised the hood on her cloak and raced through the streets toward Lord Strale's house. \u201cIt is good that he will never be king.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe following morning, the King and Queen of Camlorn held their daily audience with various nobles and diplomats, a sparse gathering.  The throne room was largely empty.  It was a terribly dull way to begin the day.  In between petitions, they yawned regally.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cWhat has happened to all the interesting people?\u201d the Queen murmured. \u201cWhere's our precious boy?\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cI've heard he was raging through the north quarter in search of some harlot who robbed him,\u201d the King chuckled fondly. \u201cWhat a fine lad.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cAnd what of the Royal Battlemage?\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cI've sent him to take care of a delicate matter,\u201d the King knit his brow. \u201cBut that was nearly a week ago, and I haven't heard one word from him.  It's somewhat troubling.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cIndeed it is, Lord Eryl should not be gone so long,\u201d the Queen frowned. \u201cWhat if a rogue sorcerer came and threatened us?  Husband, don't laugh at me, that is why all the royal houses of High Rock keep their mage retainers close to their side.  To protect their court from evil enchantments, like the one that our poor Emperor suffered so recently.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cAt the hand of his own battlemage,\u201d chuckled the King<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cLord Eryl would never betray you like that, and you well know it.  He has been in your employ since you were Duke of Oloine.  To even make that comparison between he and Jagar Tharn, really,\u201d the Queen waved her hands dismissively. \u201cIt is that sort of lack of trust that is ruining kingdoms all over Tamriel.  Now, Lord Strale tells me -\u201c<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cThere's another man that's gone missing,\u201d mused the King.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cThe ambassador?\u201d the Queen shook her head. \u201cNo, he's here.  He was desirous to visit the crypts and pay homage to your noble ancestors, so I directed him there.  I can't think what's keeping him so long.  He must be more pious than I thought.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nShe was surprised to see the King rise up, alarmed. \u201cWhy didn't you tell me?\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nBefore she had a chance to reply, the subject of their conversation was coming through the open door to the throne room.  At on his arm was a beautiful fair-haired woman in a stately gown of scarlet and gold, worthy of the highest nobility.  The queen followed her startled husband's gaze, and was likewise amazed.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cI had heard he was taken with one of the harlots from the Flower Festival, not a lady,\u201d she whispered. \u201cWhy, she looks remarkably like your daughter, the Lady Jyllia.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cThat she does,\u201d the King gasped. \u201cOr her cousin, the Princess Talara.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe nobles in the room also whispered amongst themselves.  Though few had been at court twenty years ago when the Princess had disappeared, presumed murdered like the rest of the royal family, there were still a few elder statesmen who remembered.  It was not only on throne that the word \u201cTalara\u201d passed through the air like an enchantment.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cLord Strale, will you introduce us to your lady?\u201d the Queen asked with a polite smile.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cIn a moment, your highness, but I'm afraid I must first discuss pressing matters,\u201d Lord Strale replied with a bow. \u201cMight I request a private audience?\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe King looked at the Imperial ambassador, trying to read into the man's expression.  With a wave of his hand, he dismissed the assembled and had the doors shut behind them.  No one remained in the audience room but the King, the Queen, the ambassador, a dozen royal guards, and the mysterious woman.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe ambassador pulled from his pocket a sheaf of old yellowed parchment.  \u201cYour Highness, when you ascended the throne after your brother and his family were murdered, anything that seemed important, deeds and wills, were of course kept with the clerks and ministers. His entire incidental, unimportant personal correspondence was sent to archive which is standard protocol. This letter was among them.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cWhat is this all about, sir?\u201d the King boomed. \u201cWhat does it say?\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cNothing about you, your majesty.  In truth, at the time of your majesty's ascension, no one reading it could have understood its significance.  It was a letter to the Emperor the late king your brother was penning at the time of his assassination, concerning a thief who had once been a mage-priest at the Temple of Sethiete here in Camlorn.  His name was Jagar Tharn.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cJagar Tharn?\u201d the Queen laughed nervously. \u201cWhy, we were just talking about him.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cTharn had stolen many books of powerful and forgotten spells, and lore about such artifacts as the Staff of Chaos, where it was hidden and how it could be used.  News travels slowly to westernmost High Rock, and by the time the King your brother had heard that the Emperor's new battlemage was a man named Jagar Tharn, many years had passed. The king had been writing a letter to warn the Emperor of the treachery of his Imperial Battlemage, but it was never completed.\u201d Lord Strale held up the letter. \u201cIt is dated on the day of his assassination in the year 385.  Four years before Jagar Tharn betrayed his master, and began the ten years of tyranny of the Imperial Simulacrum.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cThis is all very interesting,\u201d the King barked. \u201cBut what has it to do with me?\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cThe late King's assassination is now a matter of Imperial concern.  And I have a confession from your Royal Battlemage Lord Eryl.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe King's face lost all color: \u201cYou miserable worm, no man may threaten me.  Neither you, nor that whore, nor that letter will ever see the light of day again.  Guards!\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe royal guards unsheathed their blades and pressed forward.  As they did so, there was a sudden shimmering of light and the room was filled with Imperial nightblades, led by Proseccus.  They had been there for hours, lurking invisibly in the shadows.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cIn the name of His Imperial Majesty, Uriel Septim VII, I arrest you,\u201d said Strale.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe doors were opened, and the King and Queen were led out, heads bowed.  Gyna told Proseccus where he would most likely find their son, Prince Sylon.  The courtiers and nobles who had been in the audience chamber stared at the strange, solemn procession of their King and Queen to their own royal prison.  No one said a word.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nWhen at last a voice was heard, it startled all.  The Lady Jyllia had arrived at court. \u201cWhat is happening?  Who dares to usurp the authority of the King and Queen?\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLord Strale turned to Proseccus: \u201cWe would speak with the Lady Jyllia alone.  You know what needs to be done.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nProseccus nodded and had the doors to the throne room closed once again.  The courtiers pressed against the wood, straining to hear everything.  Though they could not say it, they wanted an explanation almost as much as her Ladyship did.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n",
