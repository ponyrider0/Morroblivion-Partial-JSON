Her throat felt like it was on fire but still she sobbed, uncontrollably, wringing her last tapestry in her hands.  Her wailing echoed throughout the hollow halls of Castle Giovese, stopping maids in their washing and guards in their conversation.  One of her women came up the narrow stairs to see her mistress, but her chief guard Zuuk stood at the doorway and shook his head.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cShe's just heard that her son is dead,\u201d he said quietly.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n5 Hearth Fire, 2920<BR>\r\nThe Imperial City, Cyrodiil<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cYour Imperial Majesty,\u201d said the Potentate Versidue-Shaie through the door. \u201cYou can open the door.  I assure you, you're perfectly safe.  No one wants to kill you.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cMara's blood!\u201d came the Emperor Reman III's voice, muffled, hysterical, tinged with madness. \u201cSomeone assassinated the Prince, and he was holding my shield!  They could have thought he was me!\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cYou're certainly correct, your Imperial Majesty,\u201d replied the Potentate, expunging any mocking qualities from his voice while his black-slitted eyes rolled contemptuously. \u201cAnd we must find and punish the evildoer responsible for your son's death.  But we cannot do it without you.  You must be brave for your Empire.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThere was no reply.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cAt the very least, come out and sign the order for Lady Rijja's execution,\u201d called the Potentate. \u201cLet us dispose of the one traitor and assassin we know of.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nA brief pause, and then the sound of furniture scraping across the floor.  Reman opened the door just a crack, but the Potentate could see his angry, fearful face, and the terrible mound of ripped tissue that used to be his right eye.  Despite the best healers in the Empire, it was still a ghastly souvenir of the Lady Rijja's work in Thurzo Fortress.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cHand me the order,\u201d the Emperor snarled. \u201cI'll sign it with pleasure.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n6 Hearth Fire, 2920<BR>\r\nGideon, Cyrodiil<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe strange blue glow of the will o' the wisps, a combination, so she'd be told, of swamp gas and spiritual energy, had always frightened Tavia as she looked out her window.  Now it seemed strangely comforting.  Beyond the bog lay the city of Gideon.  It was funny, she thought, that she had never stepped foot in its streets, though she had watched it ever day for seventeen years.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cCan you think of anything I've forgotten?\u201d she asked, turning to look back on the loyal Kothringi Zuuk.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cI know exactly what to do,\u201d he said simply.  He seemed to smile, but the Empress realized that it was only her own face reflected in his silvery skin.  She was smiling, and she didn't even realize it.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cMake certain you aren't followed,\u201d she warned. \u201cI don't want my husband to know where my gold's been hiding all these years.  And do take your share of it.  You've been a good friend.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Empress Tavia stepped forward and dropped from sight into the mists.  Zuuk replaced the bars on the tower window, and threw a blanket over some pillows on her bed.  With any luck, they would not discover her body on the lawn until morning, at which time he hoped to be halfway to Morrowind.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n9 Hearth Fire, 2920<BR>\r\nPhrygias, High Rock<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe strange trees on all sides resembled knobby piles crowned with great bursts of reds, yellows, and oranges, like insect mounds caught fire.  The Wrothgarian mountains were fading into the misty afternoon.  Turala marveled at the sight, so alien, so different from Morrowind, as she plodded the horse forward into an open pasture.  Behind her, head nodding against his chest, Cassyr slept, cradling Bosriel.  For a moment, Turala considered jumping the low painted fence that crossed the field, but she thought better of it.  Let Cassyr sleep for a few more hours before giving him the reigns.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAs the horse passed into the field, Turala saw the small green house on the next hill, half-hidden in forest.  So picturesque was the image, she felt herself lull into a pleasant half-sleeping state.  A blast of a horn brought her back to reality with a shudder.  Cassyr opened his eyes.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cWhere are we?\u201d he hissed.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cI don't know,\u201d Turala stammered, wide-eyed. \u201cWhat is that sound?\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cOrcs,\u201d he whispered. \u201cA hunting party.  Head for the thicket quickly.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nTurala trotted the horse into the small collection of trees. Cassyr handed her the child and dismounted.  He began pulling their bags off next, throwing them into the bushes.  A sound started then, a distant rumbling of footfall, growing louder and closer.  Turala climbed off carefully and helped Cassyr unburden the horse.  All the while, Bosriel watched open-eyed.  Turala sometimes worried that her baby never cried.  Now she was grateful for it.  With the last of the luggage off, Cassyr slapped the horse's rear, sending it galloping into the field.  Taking Turala's hand, he hunkered down in the bushes.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cWith luck,\u201d he murmured. \u201cThey'll think she's wild or belongs to the farm and won't go looking for the rider.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAs he spoke, a horde of orcs surged into the field, blasting their horns.  Turala had seen orcs before, but never in such abundance, never with such bestial confidence.  Roaring with delight at the horse and its confused state, they hastened past the timber where Cassyr, Turala, and Bosriel hid.  The wildflowers flew into the air at their stampede, powdering the air with seeds.  Turala tried to hold back a sneeze, and thought she succeeded.  One of the orcs heard something though, and brought another with him to investigate.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCassyr quietly unsheathed his sword, mustering all the confidence he could.  His skills, such as they were, were in spying, not combat, but he vowed to protect Turala and her babe for as long as he could.  Perhaps he would slay these two, he reasoned, but not before they cried out and brought the rest of the horde.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSuddenly, something invisible swept through the bushes like a wind.  The orcs flew backwards, falling dead on their backs.  Turala turned and saw a wrinkled crone with bright red hair emerge from a nearby bush.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cI thought you were going to bring 'em right to me,\u201d she whispered, smiling. \u201cBest come with me.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe three followed the old woman through a deep crevasse of bramble bushes that ran through the field toward the house on the hill.  As they emerged on the other side, the woman turned to look at the orcs feasting on the remains of the horse, a blood-soaked orgy to the beat of multiple horns.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cThat horse yours?\u201d she asked.  When Cassyr nodded, she laughed loudly. \u201cThat's rich meat, that is.  Those monsters'll have bellyaches and flatulence in the morning.  Serves 'em right.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cShouldn't we keep moving?\u201d whispered Turala, unnerved by the woman's laughter.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cThey won't come up here,\u201d she grinned, looking at Bosriel who smiled back. \u201cThey're too afraid of us.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nTurala turned to Cassyr, who shook his head. \u201cWitches.  Am I correct in assuming that this is Old Barbyn's Farm, the home of the Skeffington Coven?\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cYou are, pet,\u201d the old woman giggled girlishly, pleased to be so infamous. \u201cI am Mynista Skeffington.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cWhat did you do to those orcs?\u201d asked Turala. \u201cBack there in the thicket?\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cSpirit fist right side the head,\u201d Mynista said, continuing the climb up the hill.  Ahead of them was the farmhouse grounds, a well, a chicken coop, a pond, women of all ages doing chores, the laughter of children at play.  The old woman turned and saw that Turala did not understand. \u201cDon't you have witches where you come from, child?\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cNone that I know of,\u201d she said.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cThere are all sorts of wielders of magic in Tamriel,\u201d she explained. \u201cThe Psijics study magic like it's their painful duty.  The battlemages in the army on the other end of the scale hurl spells like arrows.  We witches commune and conjure and celebrate.  To fell those orcs, I merely whispered to the spirits of the air, Amaro, Pina, Tallatha, the fingers of Kynareth, and the breath of the world, with whom I have an intimate acquaintance, to smack those bastards dead.  You see, conjuration is not about might, or solving riddles, or agonizing over musty old scrolls.  It's about fostering relations.  Being friendly, you might say.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cWell, we certainly appreciate you being friendly with us,\u201d said Cassyr.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cAs well you might,\u201d coughed Mynista. \u201cYour kind destroyed the orc homeland two thousand years ago.  Before that, they never came all the way up here and bothered us.  Now let's get you cleaned up and fed.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nWith that, Mynista led them into the farm, and Turala met the family of the Skeffington Coven.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n11 Hearth Fire, 2920<BR>\r\nThe Imperial City, Cyrodiil<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRijja had not even tried to sleep the night before, and she found the somber music played during her execution to have a soporific effect.  It was as if she was willing herself to be unconscious before the ax stroke.  Her eyes were bound so she could not see her former lover, the Emperor, seated before her, glaring with his one good eye.  She could not see the Potentate Versidue-Shaie, his coil neatly wrapped beneath him, a look of triumph in his golden face.  She could feel, numbly, the executioner's hand touch her back to steady her.  She flinched like a dreamer trying to awake.  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe first blow caught the back of her head and she screamed.  The next hacked through her neck, and she was dead.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Emperor turned to the Potentate wearily, \u201cNow that's done.  You said she had a pretty sister in Hammerfell named Corda?\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n18 Hearth Fire, 2920<BR>\r\nDwynnen, High Rock<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe horse the witches had sold him was not as good as his old one, Cassyr considered.  Spirit worship and sacrifice and sisterhood might be all well and good for conjuring spirits, but it tends to spoil beasts of burden.  Still, there was little to complain about.  With the Dunmer woman and her child gone, he had made excellent time.  Ahead were the walls surrounding the city of his homeland.  Almost at once, he was set upon by his old friends and family.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cHow went the war?\u201d cried his cousin, running to the road. \u201cIs it true that Vivec signed a peace with the Prince, but the Emperor refuses to honor it?\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cThat's not how it was, was it?\u201d asked a friend, joining them. \u201cI heard that the Dunmer had the Prince murdered and then made up a story about a treaty, but there's no evidence for it.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cIsn't there anything interesting happening here?\u201d Cassyr laughed. \u201cI really don't have the least interest in discussing the war or Vivec.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cYou missed the procession of the Lady Corda,\u201d said his friend. \u201cShe came across the bay with full entourage and then east to the Imperial City.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cBut that's nothing.  What was Vivec like?\u201d asked his cousin eagerly. \u201cHe supposed to be a living god.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cIf Sheogorath steps down and they need another God of Madness, he'll do,\u201d said Cassyr haughtily.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cAnd the women?\u201d asked the lad, who had only seen Dunmer ladies on very rare occasions.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCassyr merely smiled.  Turala Skeffington flashed into his mind for an instant before fading away.  She would be happy with the coven, and her child would be well cared for.  But they were part of the past now, a place and a war he wanted to forget forever.  Dismounting his horse, he walked it into the city, chatting of trivial gossip of life on the Iliac Bay.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n",
