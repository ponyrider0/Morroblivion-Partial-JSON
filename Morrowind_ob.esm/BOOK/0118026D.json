The grahl make great guards, and I knew you'd be able to slip past them. I've paid off the crew and given the Guild its cut. I'll see you in Cyrodiil at that inn we talked about.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe museum should be an easy haul. Security is light, and there's a broken window in the basement. But we can talk more about that later.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nJacques<BR>\r\n<BR>",
