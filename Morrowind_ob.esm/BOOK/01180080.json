Some believe she was slain shortly after her imprisonment in the 121st year, while others maintain that she was likely kept alive as a hostage until shortly before her uncle Cephorus, King of Gilane, reconquered western High Rock in the summer of the 125th year.  The certainty of Kintyra's demise rallied many against the Wolf Queen Potema and her son, who had been crowned Emperor Uriel Septim III four years previously when he invaded the under-guarded Imperial City.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCephorus concentrated his army on the war in High Rock, while his brother Magnus, King of Lilmoth, brought his Argonian troops through loyal Morrowind and into Skyrim to fight in Potema's home province.  The reptilian troops fought well in the summer months, but during the winter, they retired south to regroup and attack again when the weather was warm.  At this stalemate, the War lasted out two more years.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlso, in the 125th year, Magnus's wife Hellena gave birth to their first child, a boy who they named Pelagius, after the Emperor who fathered Magnus, Cephorus, the late Emperor Antiochus, and the dread Wolf Queen of Solitude.<BR>\r\n\r\n<BR>\r\n3E 127<BR>\r\nPotema sat on soft silk cushions in the warm grass in front of her tent and watched the sun rise over the dark woods on the other side of the meadow.  It was a peculiarly vibrant morning, typical of Skyrim summertide.  The high chirrup of insects buzzed all around her and the sky surged with thousands of fallowing birds, rolling over one another and forming a multitude of patterns.  Nature was unaware of the war coming to Falconstar, she surmised.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cYour highness, a message from the army in Hammerfell,\u201d said one of her maids, bringing in a courier.  He was breathing hard, stained with sweat and mud.  Evidence of a long, fast ride over many, many miles.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cMy queen,\u201d said the courier, looking to the ground. \u201cI bring grave news of your son, the Emperor.  He met your brother King Cephorus's army in Hammerfell in the countryside of Ichidag and there did battle.  You would be proud, for he fought well, but in the end, the Imperial army was defeated and your son, our Emperor, was captured.  King Cephorus is bringing him to Gilane.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nPotema listened to the news, scowling. \u201cThat clumsy fool,\u201d she said at last.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nPotema stood up and strolled into camp, where the men were arming themselves, preparing for battle.  Long ago, the soldiers understood that their lady did not stand on ceremony, and she would prefer that they work rather than salute her.  Lord Vhokken was ahead of her, already meeting with the commander of the battlemages, discussing last minute strategy.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cMy queen,\u201d said the courier, who had been following her. \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cI'm going to win this battle with Magnus, despite his superior position holding the ruins of Kogmenthist Castle,\u201d said Potema. \u201cAnd then when I know what Cephorus means to do with the Emperor, I'll respond accordingly.  If there's a ransom to be paid, I'll pay it; if there's a prison exchange needed, so be it.  Now, please, bath yourself and rest, and try not to get in the way of the war.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cIt's not an ideal scenario,\u201d said Lord Vhokken when Potema had entered the commander's tent. \u201cIf we attack the castle from the west, we'll be running directly into the fire from their mages and archers.  If we come from the east, we'll be going through swamps, and the Argonians do better in that type of environment than we do.  A lot better.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cWhat about the north and south?  Just hills, correct?\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cVery steep hills, your highness,\u201d said the commander. \u201cWe should post bowmen there, but we'll be too vulnerable putting out the majority of our force.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cSo it's the swamp,\u201d said Potema, and added, pragmatically. \u201cUnless we withdraw and wait for them to come out before fighting.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cIf we wait, Cephorus will have his army here from High Rock, and we'll be trapped between the two of them,\u201d said Lord Vhokken. \u201cNot a preferable situation.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cI'll talk to the troops,\u201d said the commander. \u201cTry to prepare them for the swamp attack.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Potema. \u201cI'll speak to them.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nIn full battlegear, the soldiers gathered in the center of camp.  They were a motley collection of men and women, Cyrodiils, Nords, Bretons, and Dunmer, youngbloods and old veterans, the sons and daughters of nobles, shopkeepers, serfs, priests, prostitutes, farmers, academics, adventurers.  All of them under the banner of the Red Diamond, the symbol of the Imperial Family of Tamriel.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cMy children,\u201d Potema said, her voice ringing out, hanging in the still morning mist. \u201cWe have fought in many battles together, over mountaintops and beach heads, through forests and deserts.  I have seen great acts of valor from each one of you, which does my heart proud.  I have also seen dirty fighting, backstabbing, cruel and wanton feats of savagery, which pleases me equally well.  For you are all warriors.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nWarming to her theme, Potema walked the line from soldier to soldier, looking each one in the eye: \u201cWar is in your blood, in your brain, in your muscles, in everything you think and everything you do.  When this war is over, when the forces are vanquished that seek to deny the throne to the true emperor, Uriel Septim III, you may cease to be warriors.  You may choose to return to your lives before the war, to your farms and your cities, and show off your scars and tell tales of the deeds you did this day to your wondering neighbors.  But on this day, make no mistake, you are warriors.  You are war.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nShe could see her words were working.  All around her, bloodshot eyes were focusing on the slaughter to come, arms tensing around weapons.  She continued in her loudest cry, \u201cAnd you will move through the swamplands, like an unstoppable power from the blackest part of Oblivion, and you will rip the scales from the reptilian things in Kogmenthist Castle.  You are warriors, and you need not only fight, you must win.  You must win!\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe soldiers roared in response, shocking the birds from the trees all around the camp.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nFrom a vantage point on the hills to the south, Potema and Lord Vhokken had excellent views of the battle as it raged.  It looked like two swarms of two colors of insect moving back and forth over a clump of dirt which was the castle ruins.  Occasionally, a burst of flame or a cloud of acid from one of the mages would flicker over the battle arresting their attention, but hour after hour, the fighting seemed like nothing but chaos.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cA rider approaches,\u201d said Lord Vhokken, breaking the silence.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe young Redguard woman was wearing the crest of Gilane, but carried a white flag.  Potema allowed her to approach.  Like the courier from the morning, the rider was well travel-worn.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cYour Highness,\u201d she said, out of breath. \u201cI have been sent from your brother, my lord King Cephorus, to bring you dire news.  Your son Uriel was captured in Ichidag on the field in battle and from there transported to Gilane.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cI know all this,\u201d said Potema scornfully. \u201cI have couriers of my own.  You can tell your master that after I've won this battle, I'll pay whatever ransom or exchange --\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cYour Highness, an angry crowd met the caravan your son was in before it made it to Gilane,\u201d the rider said quickly, \u201cYour son is dead.  He had been burned to death within his carriage.  He is dead.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nPotema turned from the young woman and looked down at the battle.  Her soldiers were going to win.  Magnus's army was in retreat.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cOne other item of news, your highness,\u201d said the rider. \u201cKing Cephorus is being proclaimed Emperor.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nPotema did not look at the woman.  Her army was celebrating their victory.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n",
