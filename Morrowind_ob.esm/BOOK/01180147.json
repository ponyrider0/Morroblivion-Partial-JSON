Perhaps they group into larger packs when mating season is imminent.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nFemales seem to be dominant sex. Males will bring gifts of food in exchange for mating advantage. Males sometimes attacked.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLoud vocalizations heard exchanged (believed to be from males), especially at night. Fascinating.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nMales do not seem to engage in physical confrontation for reproductive rights. Some posturing, but no conflict.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAll kagouti display increased aggressiveness during mating.
