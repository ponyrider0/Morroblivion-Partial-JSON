Neither had been back in High Rock, let alone in their favorite woods for four years.  The trees had changed little even if they had.  Stryngpool had a handsome blond moustache now, stiffened and spiked with wax, and Templer seemed to be a completely alien creature to the young lad who searched for adventure in the ancient grove.  He was much quieter, as if scarred within as well as without.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThey each carried their bows and quivers with extra care as they maneuvered their way through the clusters of vine and branch.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cThis is the path that used to lead to your house, isn't it, old boy?\u201d asked Stryngpool.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nTempler glanced at the overgrowth and nodded, before continuing on.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cI thought so,\u201d said Stryngpool and laughed: \u201cI remember it because you used to run down it every time you got a bloody nose.  I know I can't offend you, but I have to say, it's hard to believe that you ended up a soldier.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cHow's your family?\u201d asked Templer.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cThe same.  A bit more pompous, if that's possible.  It's obvious they wish I'd come back from the academy, but there's nothing much for me here.  At least not until I collect my inheritance.  Did I you see I got a gold ribbon of merit in archery?\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cHow could I miss it?\u201d said Templer.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cOh yes, I nearly forgot that the family's put it in the Great Hall.  Very ostentatiously.  I suppose you can actually see it through the picture window.  Silly, but I hope the peasants are impressed.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe clearing opened up before them, where the mist settled on the grass, enveloping it in an opaque, chilly vapor.  Burlap targets were arranged around in a semi-circle, several meters apart, like sentinels.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cYou've been practicing,\u201d observed Templer.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cWell, a bit.  I've only been back in town for a few days.\u201d  said Stryngpool with a smile. \u201cMy parents said you got here a week ago?\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cThat's right.  My unit's camped a few miles east, and I thought I'd visit the old haunts.  A lot's changed, I could hardly recognize anything at all.\u201d  Templer looked down at the valley below, to the vast empty tilled ground, stretching out for miles around.  \u201cIt looks like a good planting.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cMy family's rather spread out since yours left.  There was some discussion I think about keeping your old house up, but it seemed a little sentimental.  Especially as there was fertile ground beneath.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nStryngpool strung his bow carefully.  It was a beautiful piece of art, darkest ebony and spun silver filigrees, hand-crafted for him in Wayrest.  He looked over at Templer stringing his bow, and felt a twinge of pity.  It was a sad, weathered utensil, bound together with strips of fabric.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cIf that's how they taught you to string your bow, you need some advisors from the academy in that army of yours,\u201d said Stryngpool as gently as he could. \u201cThe untightened loop is supposed to look like an X in an O.  Yours looks like a Z in a Y.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cIt works for me,\u201d said Templer. \u201cI should tell you, I won't be able to make an afternoon of this.  I'm supposed to join my unit this evening.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nStryngpool began to feel annoyed by his old friend.  If he was angry about his family losing their land, why couldn't he just say it?  Why did he come back to the valley at all?  He watched Templer nock his first arrow, taking aim at a target, and coughed.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cI'm sorry, but I can't in good faith send you back to the army without a little new wisdom.  There are three types of draw, three-fingers, thumb and index, thumb and two fingers.  Then there's the thumb draw which I like, but you see,\u201d Stryngpool showed Templer the small leather loop fastened on the cord of his bow, \u201cYou need to have one of these thingies or you'll tear your thumb right off.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cI think I like my stupid method best.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cDon't be pigheaded, Templer.  They didn't give me the gold ribbon of merit for nothing.  I had demonstrated shooting from under a shield, standing, sitting, squatting, kneeling, and sitting on horseback.  This is practical information I'm imparting for the sake of our friendship which I, at least, haven't completely forgotten.  Sweet Kynareth, I remember when you were just an oily little squirt, begging for this kind of honest guidance.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nTempler looked at Stryngpool for a moment, and lowered his bow.  \u201cShow me.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nStryngpool relaxed, shook away the tensions that had been building.  He did his exercise, drawing the bow back to his eyebrow, his moustache, his chest, his earlobe.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cThere are three ways of shooting: snatching and releasing in one continuous motion, like the Bosmer do; holding with a short draw and a pause before releasing like the Khajiit; and partial draw, pause, final draw,\u201d Stryngpool fired the arrow into the center of the target with cool precision, \u201cAnd release.  Which I prefer.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cVery nice,\u201d said Templer.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cNow you,\u201d said Stryngpool.  He helped Templer select a grip, nock his arrow correctly, and take aim.  A smile grew on Templer's face -- the first time Stryngpool had seen such a childlike expression on the war-etched visage all afternoon.  When Templer released the arrow, it rocketed high over the top of the target and into the valley below where it disappeared from sight.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cNot bad,\u201d said Templer.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cNo, not bad,\u201d said Stryngpool, feeling friendly once again. \u201cIf you practice, you should be able to focus your aim a little bit.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe two shot a few more practice bolts before parting ways.  Templer began the long trek east to his unit's camp, and Stryngpool wound his way down through the woods to the valley and his family's mansion.  He hummed a little tune he learned at the academy as he passed the great lawn and walked up to the front door, pleased with himself for helping his old friend.  It entirely escaped his attention that the large picture window was broken.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nBut he noticed right away when he came into the Great Hall, and saw Templer's wild-shot bolt sticking in his gold ribbon of merit.<BR>\r\n",
