Any combination of Marshmerrow, wickwheat, and resin will work. If properly prepared, there are no ill effects.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAnother common potion is that of restore fatigue. This can be made from scrib jelly and scuttle. Using hound meat instead of jelly may make a stronger potion, but the hound meat often spoils and makes the potion effective but undrinkable. Customers often prefer potions that taste better to ones that are only slightly more effective.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n",
