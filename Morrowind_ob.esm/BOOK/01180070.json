An ancient healer mopped a wet cloth across her head, smiling with relief.  Asleep in the chair next to her bed was Vivec.  The healer rushed to a side cabinet and returned with a flagon of water.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cHow are you feeling, goddess?\u201d asked the healer.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cLike I've been asleep for a very long time,\u201d said Almalexia.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cSo you have.  Fifteen days,\u201d said the healer, and touched Vivec's arm. \u201cMaster, wake up.  She speaks.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nVivec rose with a start, and seeing Almalexia alive and awake, his face broke into a wide grin.  He kissed her forehead, and took her hand.  At last, there was warmth again in her flesh.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlmalexia's peaceful repose suddenly snapped: \u201cSotha Sil --\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cHe's alive and well,\u201d replied Vivec. \u201cWorking on one of his machines again somewhere.  He would have stayed here too, but he realized he could do you more good working that peculiar sorcery of his.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe castellan appeared in the doorway. \u201cSorry to interrupt you, master, but I wanted to tell you that your fastest messenger left late last night for the Imperial City.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cMessenger?\u201d asked Almalexia. \u201cVivec, what has happened?\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cI was to go and sign a truce with the Emperor on the sixth, so I sent him word that it had to be postponed.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cYou can't do me any good here,\u201d said Almalexia, pulling herself up with effort. \u201cBut if you don't sign that truce, you'll put Morrowind back to war, maybe for another eighty years.  If you leave today with an escort and hurry, perhaps you can get to the Imperial City only a day or two late.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cAre you certain you don't need me here?\u201d asked Vivec.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cI know that Morrowind needs you more.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n6 Sun's Dusk, 2920<BR>\r\nThe Imperial City, Cyrodiil<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Emperor Reman III sat on his throne, surveying the audience chamber.  It was a spectacular sight: silver ribbons dangled from the rafters, burning cauldrons of sweet herbs simmered in every corner, Pyandonean swallowtails sweeping through the air, singing their songs.  When the torches were lit and servants began fanning, the room would be transfigured into a shimmering fantasy land.  He could smell the kitchen already, spices and roasts.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Potentate Versidue-Shaie and his son Savirien-Chorak slithered into the room, both bedecked in the headdress and jewelry of the Tsaesci.  There was no smile on their golden face, but there seldom was one.  The Emperor still greeted his trusted advisor with enthusiasm.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cThis ought to impress those savage Dark Elves,\u201d he laughed. \u201cWhen are they supposed to arrive?\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cA messenger's just arrived from Vivec,\u201d said the Potentate solemnly. \u201cI think it would be best if your Imperial Majesty met him alone.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Emperor lost his laughter, but nodded to his servants to withdraw.  The door then opened and the Lady Corda walked into the room, with a parchment in her hand.  She shut the door behind her, but did not look up to meet the Emperor's face.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cThe messenger gave his letter to my mistress?\u201d said Reman, incredulous, rising to take the note. \u201cThat's a highly unorthodox way of delivering a message.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cBut the message itself is very orthodox,\u201d said Corda, looking up into his one good eye.  With a single blinding motion, she brought the letter up under the Emperor's chin.  His eyes widened and blood poured down the blank parchment.  Blank that is, except for a small black mark, the sign of the Morag Tong.  It fell to the floor, revealing the small dagger hidden behind it, which she now twisted, severing his throat to the bone.  The Emperor collapsed to the floor, gasping soundlessly.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cHow long do you need?\u201d asked Savirien-Chorak.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cFive minutes,\u201d said Corda, wiping the blood from her hands. \u201cIf you can give me ten, though, I'll be doubly grateful.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cVery well,\u201d said the Potentate to Corda's back as she raced from the audience chamber.  \u201cShe ought to have been an Akaviri, the way the girl handles a blade is truly remarkable.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cI must go and establish our alibi,\u201d said Savirien-Chorak, disappearing behind one of the secret passages that only the Emperor's most trusted knew about.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cDo you remember, close to a year ago, your Imperial Majesty,\u201d the Potentate smiled, looking down at the dying man. \u201cWhen you told me to remember 'You Akaviri have a lot of showy moves, but if just one of our strikes comes through, it's all over for you.'  I remembered that, you see.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Emperor spat up blood and somehow said the word: \u201cSnake.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cI am a snake, your Imperial Majesty, inside and out.  But I didn't lie.  There was a messenger from Vivec.  It seems he'll be a little late in arriving,\u201d the Potentate shrugged before disappearing behind the secret passage. \u201cDon't worry yourself.  I'm sure the food won't go bad.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Emperor of Tamriel died in a pool of his own blood in his empty audience chamber decorated for a grand ball.  He was found by his bodyguard fifteen minutes later.  Corda was nowhere to be found.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n8 Sun's Dusk, 2920<BR>\r\nCaer Suvio, Cyrodiil<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLord Glavius, apologizing profusely for the quality of the road through the forest, was the first emissary to greet Vivec and his escort as they arrived.  A string of burning globes decorated the leafless trees surrounding the villa, bobbing in the gentle but frigid night breeze.  From within, Vivec could smell the simple feast and a high sad melody.  It was a traditional Akaviri wintertide carol.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nVersidue-Shaie greeted Vivec at the front door.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cI'm glad you received the message before you got all the way to the City,\u201d said the Potentate, guiding his guest into the large, warm drawing room. \u201cWe are in a difficult transition time, and for the moment, it is best not to conduct our business at the capitol.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cThere is no heir?\u201d asked Vivec.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cNo official one, though there are distant cousins vying for the throne.  While we sort the matter out, at least temporarily the nobles have decided that I may act in the office of my late master,\u201d Versidue-Shaie signaled for the servants to draw two comfortable chairs in front of the fireplace. \u201cWould you feel most comfortable if we signed the treaty officially right now, or would you like to eat something first?\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cYou intend to honor the Emperor's treaty?\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cI intend to do everything as the Emperor,\u201d said the Potentate.  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n14 Sun's Dusk, 2920<BR>\r\nTel Aruhn, Morrowind<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCorda, dusty from the road, flew into the Night Mother's arms.  For a moment, they stayed locked together, the Night Mother stroking her daughter's hair, kissing her forehead.  Finally, she reached into her sleeve and handed Corda a letter.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d asked Corda.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cA letter from the Potentate, expressing his delight at your expertise,\u201d replied the Night Mother. \u201cHe's promised to send us payment, but I've already sent him back a reply.  The late Empress paid us enough for her husband's death.  Mephala would not have us be greedy beyond our needs.  You should not be paid twice for the same murder, so it is written.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cHe killed Rijja, my sister,\u201d said Corda quietly.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cAnd so it should be that you struck the blow.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cWhere will I go now?\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cWhenever any of our holy workers becomes too famous to continue the crusade, we send them to an island called Vounoura.  It's not more than a month's voyage by boat, and I've arranged for a delightful estate for your sanctuary,\u201d the Night Mother kissed the girl's tears. \u201cYou meet many friends there, and I know you will find peace and happiness at last, my child.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n19 Sun's Dusk, 2920<BR>\r\nMournhold, Morrowind<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlmalexia surveyed the rebuilding of the town.  The spirit of the citizens was truly inspirational, she thought, as she walked among the skeletons of new buildings standing in the blackened, shattered remains of the old.  Even the plantlife showed a remarkable resilience.  There was life yet in the blasted remains of the comberry and roobrush shrubs that once lined the main avenue.  She could feel the pulse.  Come springtide, green would bolt through the black.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Duke's heir, a lad of considerable intelligence and sturdy Dunmer courage, was coming down from the north to take his father's place.  The land would do more than survive: it would strengthen and expand.  She felt the future much more strongly than she saw the present.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nOf all the things she was most certain of, she knew that Mournhold was forever home to at least one goddess.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n22 Sun's Dusk, 2920<BR>\r\nThe Imperial City, Cyrodiil<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cThe Cyrodiil line is dead,\u201d announced the Potentate to the crowd gathered beneath the Speaker's Balcony of the Imperial Palace.  \u201cBut the Empire lives.  The distant relatives of our beloved Emperor have been judged unworthy of the throne by the trusted nobility who advised his Imperial Majesty throughout his long and illustrious reign.  It has been decided that as an impartial and faithful friend of Reman III, I will have the responsibility of continuing on in his name.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Akaviri paused, allowing his words to echo and translate into the ears of the populace.  They merely stared up at him in silence.  The rain had washed through the streets of the city, but the sun, for a brief time, appeared to be offering a respite from the winter storms.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cI want to make it clear that I am not taking the title Emperor,\u201d he continued. \u201cI have been and will continue to be Potentate Versidue-Shaie, an alien welcomed kindly to your shores.  It will be my duty to protect my adopted homeland, and I pledge to work tirelessly at this task until someone more worthy takes the burden from me.  As my first act, I declare that in commemoration of this historical moment, beginning on the first of Morning Star, we will enter year one of the Second Era as time will be reckoned.  Thus, we mourn the loss of our Imperial family, and look forward to the future.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nOnly one man clapped at these words.  King Dro'Zel of Senchal truly believed that this would be the finest thing to happen to Tamriel in history.  Of course, he was quite mad.    <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n31 Sun's Dusk, 2920<BR>\r\nEbonheart, Morrowind<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nIn the smoky catacombs beneath the city where Sotha Sil forged the future with his arcane clockwork apparatus, something unforeseen happened.  An oily bubble seeped from a long trusted gear and popped.  Immediately, the wizard's attention was drawn to it and to the chain that tiny action triggered.  A pipe shifted half an inch to the left.  A tread skipped.  A coil rewound itself and began spinning in a counter direction.  A piston that had been thrusting left-right, left-right, for millennia suddenly began shifting right-left.  Nothing broke, but everything changed.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cIt cannot be fixed now,\u201d said the sorcerer quietly.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nHe looked up through a crick in the ceiling into the night sky.  It was midnight.  The second era, the age of chaos, had begun.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n",
