But your competition has an equal claim.  This is what makes my particular profession difficult at times.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cYou would call it my competition?\u201d sneered Lord Bowyn, gesturing to the Orc.  The creature, called Gortwog gro-Nagorm, looked up with baleful eyes.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cHe has ample documentation to make a claim on the land,\u201d the magistrate shrugged. \u201cAnd the particular laws of our land do not discriminate between particular races.  We had a Bosmer regency once, many generations ago.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cBut what if a pig or a slaughterfish turned up demanding the property?  Would they have the same legal rights as I?\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cIf they had the proper papers, I'm afraid so,\u201d smiled the judge. \u201cThe law is very clear that if two claimants with equal titles to the property are set in deadlock, a duel must be held.  Now, the rules are fairly archaic, but I've had opportunity to look them over, and I think they're still valid.  The Imperial council agrees.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cWhat must we do?\u201d asked the Orc, his voice low and harsh, unused to the tongue of the Cyrodiils.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cThe first claimant, that's you, Lord Gortwog, may choose the armor and weapon of the duelists.  The second claimant, that's you, Lord Bowyn, may choose the location.  If you would prefer, either or both you may choose a champion or you may duel yourself.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Breton and the Orc looked at one another, evaluating.  Finally, Gortwog spoke, \u201cThe armor will be Orcish and the weapons will be common steel long swords.  No enchantments.  No wizardry allowed.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cThe arena will be the central courtyard of my cousin Lord Berylth's palace in Wayrest,\u201d said Bowyn, looking Gortwog in the eye scornfully. \u201cNone of your kind will be allowed in to witness.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSo it was agreed.  Gortwog declared that he would fight the duel himself, and Bowyn, who was a fairly young man and in better than average condition, felt that he could not keep his honor without competing himself as well.  Still, upon arriving at his cousin's palace a week before the duel was scheduled, he felt the need to practice.  A suit of Orcish armor was purchased and for the first time in his life, Bowyn wore something of tremendous weight and limited facility.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nBowyn and Berylth sparred in the courtyard.  In ten minutes times, Bowyn had to stop.  He was red-faced and out of breath from trying to move in the armor: to add to his exasperation, he had not scored one blow on his cousin, and had dozens of feinted strikes scored on him.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cI don't know what to do,\u201d said Bowyn over dinner. \u201cEven if I knew someone who could fight properly in that beastly steel, I couldn't possibly send in a champion to battle Gortwog.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nBerylth commiserated.  As the servants cleared the plates, Bowyn stood up in his seat and pointed at one of them: \u201cYou didn't tell me you had an Orc in your household!\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cSir?\u201d whined the elderly specimen, turning to Lord Berylth, certain that he caused offense somehow.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cYou mean Old Tunner?\u201d laughed Berylith. \u201cHe's been with my house for ages.  Would you like him to give you training on how to move in Orcish armor?\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cWould you like me to?\u201d asked Tunner obsequiously.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nUnknown to Berylith but known to him now, his servant had once ridden with the legendary Cursed Legion of High Rock.  He not only knew how to fight in Orcish armor himself, but he had acted as trainer to other Orcs before retiring into domestic service.  Desperate, Bowyn immediately engaged him as his full-time trainer.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cYour try too hard, sir,\u201d said the Orc on their first day in the arena. \u201cIt is easy to strain yourself in heavy mail.  The joints are just so to let you to bend with only a little effort.  If you fight against the joints, you won't have any strength to fight your foe.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nBowyn tried to follow Tunner's instructions, but he quickly grew frustrated.  And the more frustrated he got, the more intensity he put into his work, which tired him out even quicker.  While he took a break to drink some water, Berylith spoke to his servant.  If they were optimistic about Bowyn's chances, their faces did not show it.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nTunner trained Bowyn hard the next two days, but her Ladyship Elysora's birthday followed hard upon them, and Bowyn enjoyed the feast thoroughly.  A liquor of poppies and goose fat, and cock tinsh with buttered hyssop for a first course; roasted pike, combwort, and balls of rabbit meat for a second; sliced fox tongues, ballom pudding with oyster gravy, battaglir weed and beans for the main course; collequiva ice and sugar fritters for dessert.  As Bowyn was settling back afterwards, his eyes weary, he suddenly spied Gortwog and the judge entering the room.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d he cried. \u201cThe duel's not for another two days!\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cLord Gortwog asked that we move it to tonight,\u201d said the judge. \u201cYou were training when my emisary arrived two days ago, but his lordship your cousin spoke for you, agreeing to the change of date.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cBut there's no time to assemble my supporters,\u201d complained Bowyn. \u201cAnd I've just devoured a feast that would kill a lesser man.  Cousin, how could you neglect to tell me?\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cI spoke to Tunner about it,\u201d said Berylith, blushing, unused to deception. \u201cWe decided that you would be best served under these conditions.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe battle in the arena was sparsely attended.  Saturated with food, Bowyn found himself unable to move very quickly.  To his surprise, the armor responded to his lethargy, rotating smoothly and elegantly to each stagger.  The more he successfully maneuvered, the more he allowed his mind and not his body to control his defensive and offensive actions.  For the first time in his life, Bowyn saw what it was to look through the helmet of an Orc.  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nOf course, he lost, and rather badly if scores had been tabulated.  Gortwog was a master of such battle.  But Bowyn fought on for more than three hours before the judge reluctantly called a winner.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cI will name the land Orsinium after the land of my fathers,\u201d said the victor.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nBowyn's first thought was that if he must lose to an Orc, it was best that the battle was largely unwatched by his friends and family.  As he left the courtyard to go to the bed he had longed for earlier in the evening, he saw Gortwog speaking to Tunner.  Though he did not understand the language, he could see that they knew each other.  When the Breton was in bed, he had a servant bring the old Orc to him.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cTunner,\u201d he said kindly. \u201cSpeak frankly to me.  You wanted Lord Gortwog to win.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cThat is true,\u201d said Tunner. \u201cBut I did not fail you.  You fought better than you would have fought two days hence, sir.  I did not want Orsinium to be won by its king without a fight.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n",
