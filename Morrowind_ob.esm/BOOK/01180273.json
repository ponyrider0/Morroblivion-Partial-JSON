They should be easy enough to get rid of.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nEntry 2: We've done it! The bears and wolves have been driven from the cave, and we've already started making ourselves at home. May our children's children enjoy the comfort of Legge!<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nEntry 3: One of those blasted bears got into the cave today. We drove him out, but he managed to make off with our dinner. It's a good thing I have my grandfather's enchanted ring to keep them at bay.<BR>\r\n<BR>",
