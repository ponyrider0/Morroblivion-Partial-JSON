But he realized that it was the artist, and he merely the witness to its magic.  He was furious and jealous.  With a cry, he snapped the quill in half. <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nHe turned to finish his glass of mead.  When he turned around, the quill was intact.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nHe had no other quills but the one he had enchanted, so he dipped his finger in the inkwell and wrote a note to Gorgos in big sloppy letters.  When Gorgos returned with a new batch of congratulatory messages from the Temple, praising his latest Bulletin, he handed the note and the quill to the messenger boy.  The note read: \u201cTake the quill back to the Mages Guild and sell it.  Buy me another quill with no enchantments.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nGorgos didn't know what to make of the note, but he did as he was told.  He returned a few hours later.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cThey wouldn't give us any gold back for it,\u201d said Gorgos. \u201cThey said it wasn't enchanted.  I told 'em, I said 'What are you talking about, you enchanted it right here with that Feyfolken soul gem,' and they said, 'Well, there ain't a soul in it now.  Maybe you did something and it got loose.'\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nGorgos paused to look at his master.  Thaurbad couldn't speak, of course, but he seemed even more than usually speechless.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cAnyway, I threw the quill away and got you this new one, like you said.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThaurbad studied the new quill.  It was white-feathered while his old quill had been dove gray. It felt good in his hand.  He sighed with relief and waved his messenger lad away.  He had a Bulletin to write, and this time, without any magic except for his own talent.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nWithin two days time, he was nearly back on schedule. It looked plain but it was entirely his. Thaurbad felt a strange reassurance when he ran his eyes over the page and noticed some slight errors. It had been a long time since the Bulletin contained any errors. In fact, Thaurbad reflected happily, there were probably other mistakes still in the document that he was not seeing.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nHe was finishing a final whirl of plain calligraphy on the borders when Gorgos arrived with some messages from the Temple. He looked through them all quickly, until one caught his eye.  The wax seal on the letter read \u201cFeyfolken.\u201d  With complete bafflement, he broke it open.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cI think you should kill yourself,\u201d it read in perfectly gorgeous script. <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nHe dropped the letter to the floor, seeing sudden movement on the Bulletin.  Feyfolken script leapt from the letter and coursed over the scroll in a flood, translating his shabby document into a work of sublime beauty. Thaurbad no longer cared about the weird croaking quality of his voice. He screamed for a very long time. And then drank. Heavily.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nGorgos brought Thaurbad a message from Vanderthil, the secretary of the Temple, early Fredas morning, but it took the scribe until mid-morning to work up the courage to look at it. \u201cGood Morning, I am just checking in on the Bulletin. You usually have it in on Turdas night. I'm curious. You planning something special? -- Vanderthil.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThaurbad responded, \u201cVanderthil, I'm sorry. I've been sick. There won't be a Bulletin this Sunday\u201d and handed the note to Gorgos before retiring to his bath.  When he came back an hour later, Gorgos was just returning from the Temple, smiling.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cVanderthil and the archpriest went crazy,\u201d he said. \u201cThey said it was your best work ever.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThaurbad looked at Gorgos, uncomprehending.  Then he noticed that the Bulletin was gone.  Shaking, he dipped his finger in the inkwell and scrawled the words \u201cWhat did the note I sent with you say?\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cYou don't remember?\u201d asked Gorgos, holding back a smile.  He knew the master had been drinking a lot lately.  \u201cI don't remember the exact words, but it was something like, 'Vanderthil, here it is. Sorry it's late. I've been having severe mental problems lately. - Thaurbad.'  Since you said, 'here it is,' I figured you wanted me to bring the Bulletin along, so I did.  And like I said, they loved it.  I bet you get three times as much letters this Sundas.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThaurbad nodded his head, smiled, and waved the messenger lad away.  Gorgos returned back to the Temple, while his master turned to his writing plank, and pulled out a fresh sheet of parchment.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nHe wrote with the quill: \u201cWhat do you want, Feyfolken?\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe words became: \u201cGoodbye. I hate my life. I have cut my wrists.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThaurbad tried another tact: \u201cHave I gone insane?\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe words became: \u201cGoodbye. I have poison. I hate my life.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cWhy are you doing this to me?\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cI Thaurbad Hulzik cannot live with myself and my ingratitude. That's why I've put this noose around my neck.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThaurbad picked up a fresh parchment, dipped his finger in the inkwell, and proceeded to rewrite the entire Bulletin. While his original draft, before Feyfolken had altered it, had been simple and flawed, the new copy was a scrawl. Lower-case I's were undotted, G's looked like Y's, sentences ran into margins and curled up and all over like serpents. Ink from the first page leaked onto the second page. When he yanked the pages from the notebook, a long tear nearly divided the third page in half. Something about the final result was evocative. Thaurbad at least hoped so. He wrote another note reading, simply, \u201cUse this Bulletin instead of the piece of shit I sent you.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nWhen Gorgos returned with new messages, Thaurbad handed the envelope to him.  The new letters were all the same, except for one from his healer, Telemichiel. \u201cThaurbad, we need you to come in as soon as possible. We've received the reports from Black Marsh about a strain of the Crimson Plague that sounds very much like your disease, and we need to re-examine you. Nothing is definite yet, but we're going to want to see what our options are.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nIt took Thaurbad the rest of the day and fifteen drams of the stoutest mead to recover. The larger part of the next morning was spent recovering from this means of recovery. He started to write a message to Vanderthil: \u201cWhat did you think of the new Bulletin?\u201d with the quill.  Feyfolken's improved version was \u201cI'm going to ignite myself on fire, because I'm a dying no-talent.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThaurbad rewrote the note using his finger-and-ink message.  When Gorgos appeared, he handed him the note.  There was one message in Vanderthil's handwriting.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nIt read, \u201cThaurbad, not only are you divinely inspired, but you have a great sense of humor.  Imagine us using those scribbles you sent instead of the real Bulletin.  You made the archbishop laugh heartily.  I cannot wait to see what you have next week.  Yours fondly, Vanderthil.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe funeral service a week later brought out far more friends and admirers than Thaurbad Hulzik would've believed possible. The coffin, of course, had to be closed, but that didn't stop the mourners from filing into lines to touch its smooth oak surface, imagining it as the flesh of the artist himself. The archbishop managed to rise to the occasion and deliver a better than usual eulogy. Thaurbad's old nemesis, the secretary before Vanderthil, Alfiers came in from Cloudrest, wailing and telling all who would listen that Thaurbad's suggestions had changed the direction of her life. When she heard Thaurbad had left her his quill in his final testament, she broke down in tears. Vanderthil was even more inconsolable, until she found a handsome and delightfully single young man.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cI can hardly believe he's gone and I never even saw him face-to-face or spoke to him,\u201d she said. \u201cI saw the body, but even if he hadn't been all burned up, I wouldn't have been able to tell if it was him or not.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cI wish I could tell you there'd been a mistake, but there was plenty of medical evidence,\u201d said Telemichiel. \u201cI supplied some of it myself. He was a patient of mine, you see.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cOh,\u201d said Vanderthil. \u201cWas he sick or something?\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cHe had the Crimson Plague years ago, that's what took away his voice box, but it appeared to have gone into complete remission. Actually, I had just sent him a note telling him words to that effect the day before he killed himself.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cYou're that healer?\u201d exclaimed Vanderthil. \u201cThaurbad's messenger boy Gorgos told me that he had just picked up that message when I sent mine, complementing him on the new, primative design for the Bulletin. It was amazing work. I never would've told him this, but I had begun to suspect he was stuck in an outmoded style. It turned out he had one last work of genius, before going out in a blaze of glory. Figuratively. And literally.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nVanderthil showed the healer Thaurbad's last Bulletin, and Telemichiel agreed that its frantic, nearly illegible style spoke volumes about the power and majesty of the god Auri-El.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cNow I'm thoroughly confused,\u201d said Vonguldak.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cAbout which part?\u201d asked the Great Sage. \u201cI think the tale is very straight-forward.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cFeyfolken made all the Bulletins beautiful, except for the last one, the one Thaubad did for himself,\u201d said Taksim thoughtfully. \u201cBut why did he misread the notes from Vanderthil and the healer?  Did Feyfolken change those words?\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cPerhaps,\u201d smiled the Great Sage.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cOr did Feyfolken changed Thaurbad's perceptions of those words?\u201d asked Vonguldak. \u201cDid Feyfolken make him mad after all?\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cVery likely,\u201d said the Great Sage.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cBut that would mean that Feyfolken was a servitor of Sheogorath,\u201d said Vonguldak. \u201cAnd you said he was a servitor of Clavicus Vile.  Which was he, an agent of mischief or an agent of insanity?\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cThe will was surely altered by Feyfolken,\u201d said Taksim, \u201cAnd that's the sort of thing a servitor of Clavicus Vile would do to perpetuate the curse.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cAs an appropriate ending to the tale of the scribe and his cursed quill,\u201d smiled the Great Sage. \u201cI will let you read into it as you will.\u201d<BR>\r\n",
