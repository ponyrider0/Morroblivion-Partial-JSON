I thought perhaps you were ... indisposed with the lovely Rijja.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cShe's taking the baths at Mir Corrup,\u201d the Emperor Reman III said miserably.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cPlease, come in.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cI've reached the stage where I can only trust three people: you, my son the Prince, and Rijja,\u201d said the Emperor petulantly. \u201cMy entire council is nothing but a pack of spies.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cWhat seems to be the matter, your imperial majesty?\u201d asked the Potentate Versidue-Shaie sympathetically, drawing closed the thick curtain in his chamber.  Instantly all sound outside the room was extinguished, echoing footsteps in the marble halls and birds in the springtide gardens.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cI've discovered that a notorious poisoner, an Orma tribeswoman from Black Marsh called Catchica, was with the army at Caer Suvio while we were encamped there when my son was poisoned, before the battle at Bodrum.  I'm sure she would have preferred to kill me, but the opportunity didn't present itself,\u201d The Emperor fumed. \u201cThe Council suggests that we need evidence of her involvement before we prosecute.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cOf course they would,\u201d said the Potentate thoughtfully. \u201cParticularly if one or more of them was in on the plot.  I have a thought, your imperial majesty.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d said Reman impatiently. \u201cOut with it!\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cTell the Council you're dropping the matter, and I will send out the Guard to track this Catchica down and follow her.  We will see who her friends are, and perhaps get an idea of the scope of this plot on your imperial majesty's life.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Reman with a satisfied frown. \u201cThat's a capital plan.  We will track this scheme to whomever it leads to.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cDecidedly, your imperial majesty,\u201d smiled the Potentate, parting the curtain so the Emperor could leave.  In the hallway outside was Versidue-Shaie's son, Savirien-Chorak.  The boy bowed to the Emperor before entering the Potentate's chamber.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cAre you in trouble, father?\u201d whispered the Akaviri lad. \u201cI heard the Emperor found out about whatshername, the poisoner.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cThe great art of speechcraft, my boy,\u201d said Versidue-Shaie to his son. \u201cIs to tell them what they want to hear in a way that gets them to do what you want them to do.  I need you to get a letter to Catchica, and make certain that she understands that if she does not follow the instructions perfectly, she is risking her own life more than ours.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n13 Second Seed, 2920<BR>\r\nMir Corrup, Cyrodiil<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRijja sank luxuriantly into the burbling hot spring, feeling her skin tingle like it was being rubbed by millions of little stones.  The rock shelf over her head sheltered her from the misting rain, but let all the sunshine in, streaming in layers through the branches of the trees.  It was an idyllic moment in an idyllic life, and when she was finished she knew that her beauty would be entirely restored.  The only thing she needed was a drink of water.  The bath itself, while wonderfully fragrant, tasted always of chalk.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cWater!\u201d she cried to her servants. \u201cWater, please!\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nA gaunt woman with rags tied over her eyes ran to her side and dropped a goatskin of water. Rijja was about to laugh at the woman's prudery -- she herself was not ashamed of her naked body -- but then she noticed through a crease in the rags that the old woman had no eyes at all.  She was like one of those Orma tribesmen Rijja had heard about, but never met.  Born without eyes, they were masters of their other senses.  The Lord of Mir Corrup hired very exotic servants, she thought to herself.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nIn a moment, the woman was gone and forgotten. Rijja found it very hard to concentrate on anything but the sun and the water.  She opened the cork, but the liquid within had a strange, metallic smell to it.  Suddenly, she was aware that she was not alone.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cLady Rijja,\u201d said the captain of the Imperial Guard. \u201cYou are, I see, acquainted with Catchica?\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cI've never heard of her,\u201d stammered Rijja before becoming indignant. \u201cWhat are you doing here?  This body is not for your leering eyes.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cNever heard of her, when we saw her with you not a minute ago,\u201d said the captain, picking up the goatskin and smelling it. \u201cBrought you neivous ichor, did she?  To poison the Emperor with?\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cCaptain,\u201d said one of the guards, running up to him quickly. \u201cWe cannot find the Argonian.  It is as if she disappeared into the woods.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cYes, they're good at that,\u201d said the captain. \u201cNo matter though. We've got her contact at court.  That should please his Imperial Majesty.  Seize her.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAs the guards pulled the writhing naked woman from the pool, she screamed, \u201cI'm innocent!  I don't know what this is all about, but I've done nothing!  The Emperor will have your heads for this!\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cYes, I imagine he will,\u201d smiled the captain. \u201cIf he trusts you.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n21 Second Seed, 2920<BR>\r\nGideon, Black Marsh<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Sow and Vulture tavern was the sort of out-of-the-way place that Zuuk favored for these sorts of interviews.  Besides himself and his companion, there were only a couple of old seadogs in the shadowy room, and they were more unconscious from drink than aware.  The grime of the unwashed floor was something you felt rather than saw.  Copious dust hung in the air unmoving in the sparse rays of dying sunlight.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cYou have experience in heavy combat?\u201d asked Zuuk. \u201cThe reward is good for this assignment, but the risks are great as well.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cCertainly I have combat experience,\u201d replied Miramor haughtily. \u201cI was at the Battle of Bodrum just two months ago.  If you do your part and get the Emperor to ride through Dozsa Pass with a minimal escort on the day and the time we've discussed, I'll do my part.  Just be certain that he's not traveling in disguise.  I'm not going to slaughter every caravan that passes through in the hopes that it contains Emperor Reman.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nZuuk smiled, and Miramor looked at himself in the Kothringi's reflective face.  He liked the way he looked: the consummate confident professional.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cAgreed,\u201d said Zuuk. \u201cAnd then you shall have the rest of your gold.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nZuuk placed the large chest onto the table between them.  He stood up.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cWait a few minutes before leaving,\u201d said Zuuk. \u201cI don't want you following me.  Your employers wish to maintain their anonymity, if by chance you are caught and tortured.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cFine by me,\u201d said Miramor, ordering more grog.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nZuuk rode his mount through the cramped labyrinthine streets of Gideon, and both he and his horse were happy to pass through the gates into the country.  The main road to Castle Giovese was flooded as it was every year in springtide, but Zuuk knew a shorter way over the hills.  Riding fast under trees drooping with moss and treacherous slime-coated rocks, he arrived at the castle gates in two hours' time.  He wasted no time in climbing to Tavia's cell at the top of the highest tower.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cWhat did you think of him?\u201d asked the Empress.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cHe's a fool,\u201d replied Zuuk. \u201cBut that's what we want for this sort of assignment.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n30 Second Seed, 2920<BR>\r\nThurzo Fortress, Cyrodiil<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRijja screamed and screamed and screamed.  Within her cell, her only audience was the giant gray stones, crusted with moss but still sturdy.  The guards outside were deaf to her as they were deaf to all prisoners.  The Emperor, miles away in the Imperial City, had likewise been deaf to her cries of innocence.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nShe screamed knowing well that no one would likely hear her ever again.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n31 Second Seed, 2920<BR>\r\nKavas Rim Pass, Cyrodiil<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nIt had been days, weeks since Turala had seen another human face, Cyrodiil or Dunmer.  As she trod the road, she thought to herself how strange it was that such an uninhabited place as Cyrodiil had become the Imperial Province, seat of an Empire.  Even the Bosmer in Valenwood must have more populated forests than this Heartland wood.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nShe thought back.  Was it a month ago, two, when she crossed the border from Morrowind into Cyrodiil?  It had been much colder then, but other than that, she had no sense of time.  The guards had been brusque, but as she was carrying no weaponry, they elected to let her through.  Since then, she had seen a few caravans, even shared a meal with some adventurers camping for the night, but met no one who would give her a ride to a town.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nTurala stripped off her shawl and dragged it behind her.  For a moment, she thought she heard someone behind her and spun around.  No one was there.  Just a bird perched on a branch making a sound like laughter.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nShe walked on, and then stopped.  Something was happening.  The child had been kicking in her belly for some time now, but this was a different kind of spasm.  With a groan, she lurched over to the side of the path, collapsing into the grass.  Her child was coming.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nShe lay on her back and pushed, but she could barely see with her tears of pain and frustration.  How had it come to this?  Giving birth in the wilderness, all by herself, to a child whose father was the Duke of Mournhold?  Her scream of rage and agony shook the birds from the trees.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe bird that had been laughing at her earlier flew down to the road.  She blinked, and the bird was gone and in its place, a naked Elf man stood, not as dark as a Dunmer, but not as pale as the Altmer.  She knew at once it was an Ayleid, a Wild Elf.  Turala screamed, but the man held her down.  After a few minutes of struggle, she felt a release, and then fainted away.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nWhen she awoke, it was to the sound of a baby crying.  The child had been cleaned and was lying by her side.  Turala picked up her baby girl, and for the first time that year, felt tears of happiness stream down her face.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nShe whispered to the trees, \u201cThank you\u201d and began walking with babe in her arms down the road to the west.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Year Is Continued in Mid Year.<BR>\r\n",
