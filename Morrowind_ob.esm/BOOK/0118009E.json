Barenziah wanted to join the Thieves Guild, knowing there would be trouble if she were caught freelancing.  One day in a barroom she caught the eye of a known member of the Guild, a bold young Khajiit named Therris.  She offered to bed him if he would sponsor her membership.  He looked her over, grinning, and agreed, but said she'd still have to pass an initiation.  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cWhat sort of initiation?\u201d  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cAh,\u201d Therris said.  \u201cPay up first, sweetness.\u201d<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n[This passage has been censored by order of the Temple.]<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nStraw was going to kill her, and maybe Therris too.  What in Tamriel had possessed her to do such a thing?  She cast an apprehensive look around the room, but the other patrons had lost interest and gone back to their own business.  She did not recognize any of them; this wasn't the inn where she and Straw were staying.  With luck it'd be a while, or never, before Straw found out.  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n***<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nTherris was by far the most exciting and attractive man she had yet met.  He not only told her about the skills she needed to become a member of the Thieves Guild, but also trained her in them himself or else introduced her to people who could.  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAmong these was a woman who knew something about magic.  Katisha was a plump and matronly Nord.  She was married to a smith, had two teenage children, and was perfectly ordinary and respectable--except that she was very fond of cats (and by logical inference, their humanoid counterparts the Khajiit), had a talent for certain kinds of magic, and cultivated rather odd friends.  She taught Barenziah an invisibility spell and schooled her in other forms of stealth and disguise.  Katisha mingled magical and non-magical talents freely, using one set to enhance the other.  She was not a member of the Thieves Guild but was fond of Therris in a motherly sort of way.  Barenziah warmed to her as she never had toward any woman, and over the next few weeks she told Katisha all about herself.  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nShe brought Straw there too sometimes.  Straw approved of Katisha.  But not of Therris.  Therris found Straw \u201cinteresting\u201d and suggested to Barenziah that they arrange what he called a \u201cthreesome.\u201d  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d Barenziah said firmly, grateful that Therris had broached the subject in private for once.  \u201cHe wouldn't like it.  I wouldn't like it!\u201d  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nTherris smiled his charming, triangular feline smile and sprawled lazily on his chair, stretching his limbs and curling his tail.  \u201cYou might be surprised.  Both of you.  Pairing is so boring.\u201d  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nBarenziah answered him with a glare.  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cOr maybe you wouldn't like it with that country bumpkin of yours, sweetness.  Would you mind if I brought along another friend?\u201d  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cYes, I would.  If you're bored with me, you and your friend can find someone else.\u201d  She was a member of the Thieves Guild now.  She had passed their initiation.  She found Therris useful but not essential.  Maybe she was a bit bored with him too.  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n***<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nShe talked to Katisha about her problems with men.  Or what she thought of as her problems with men.  Katisha shook her head and told her she was looking for love, not sex, that she'd know the right man when she found him, that neither Straw nor Therris was the right one for her.  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nBarenziah cocked her head to one side quizzically.  \u201cThey say Dark Elven women are pro-- pro-- something.  Prostitutes?\u201d she said, although she was dubious.  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cYou mean promiscuous.  Although some do become prostitutes, I suppose,\u201d Katisha said as an afterthought.  \u201cElves are promiscuous when they're young.  But you'll outgrow it.  Perhaps you're beginning to already,\u201d she added hopefully.  She liked Barenziah, had grown to be quite fond of her.  \u201cYou ought to meet some nice Elven boys, though.  If you go on keeping company with Khajiits and humans and what have you, you'll find yourself pregnant in next to no time.\u201d  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nBarenziah smiled involuntarily at the thought.  \u201cI'd like that.  I think.  But it would be inconvenient, wouldn't it?  Babies are a lot of trouble, and I don't even have my own house yet.\u201d  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cHow old are you, Berry?  Seventeen?  Well, you've a year or two yet before you're fertile, unless you're very unlucky.  Elves don't have children readily with other Elves after that, even, so you'll be all right if you stick with them.\u201d  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nBarenziah remembered something else.  \u201cStraw wants to buy a farm and marry me.\u201d  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cIs that what you want?\u201d  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cNo.  Not yet.  Maybe someday.  Yes, someday.  But not if I can't be queen.  And not just any queen.  The Queen of Mournhold.\u201d  She said this determinedly, almost stubbornly, as if to drown out any doubt.  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nKatisha chose to ignore this last comment.  She was amused at the girl's hyperactive imagination, took it as a sign of a well-functioning mind.  \u201cI think Straw will be a very old man before 'someday' comes, Berry.  Elves live for a very long time.\u201d  Katisha's face briefly wore the envious, wistful look humans got when contemplating the thousand-year lifespan Elves had been granted by the gods.  True, few ever actually lived that long as disease and violence took their respective tolls.  But they could.  And one or two of them actually did.  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cI like old men too,\u201d Berry said.  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nKatisha laughed.  <BR>\r\nBarenziah fidgeted impatiently while Therris sorted through the papers on the desk.  He was being meticulous and methodical, carefully replacing everything just as he'd found it.  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThey'd broken into a nobleman's household, leaving Straw to hover outside as lookout.  Therris had said it was a simple job but very hush-hush.  He hadn't even wanted to bring any other Guild members along.  He said he knew he could trust Berry and Straw, but no one else.  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cTell me what you're looking for and I'll find it,\u201d Berry whispered urgently.  Therris' night sight wasn't as good as hers and he didn't want her to magick up even a small orb of light.  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nShe had never been in such a luxurious place.  Not even the Darkmoor castle of Count Sven and Lady Inga where she had spent her childhood compared to it.  She'd gazed around in wonder as they made their way through the ornately decorated and hugely echoing downstairs rooms.  But Therris didn't seem interested in anything but the desk in the small book-lined study on the upper floor.  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cSssst,\u201d he hissed angrily.  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cSomeone's coming!\u201d Berry said, a moment before the door opened and two dark figures stepped into the room.  Therris gave her a violent shove toward them and sprang to the window.  Barenziah's muscles went rigid; she couldn't move or even speak.  She watched helplessly as one of the figures, the smaller one, leaped after Therris.  There were two quick, silent stabs of blue light, then Therris folded over into a still heap.  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nOutside the study the house had come alive with hastening footsteps and voices calling out in alarm and the clank of armor hurriedly put on.  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe bigger man, a Dark Elf by the looks of him, half-lifted, half-dragged Therris to the door and thrust him into the waiting arms of another Elf.  A jerk of the first Elf's head sent his smaller blue-robed companion after them.  Then he sauntered over to inspect Barenziah, who was once again able to move although her head throbbed maddeningly when she tried to.  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cOpen your shirt, Barenziah,\u201d the Elf said.  Barenziah gawked at him and clutched it closed.  \u201cYou're a girl, aren't you, Berry?\u201d he said softly.  \u201cYou should have stopped dressing as a boy months ago, you know.  You were only drawing attention to yourself.  And calling yourself Berry!  Is your friend Straw too stupid to remember anything else?\u201d  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cIt's a common Elven name,\u201d Barenziah defended.  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe man shook his head sadly.  \u201cNot among Dark Elves it isn't, my dear.  But you wouldn't know much about Dark Elves, would you?  I regret that, but it couldn't be helped.  No matter.  I shall try to remedy it.\u201d  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d Barenziah demanded.  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cAi.  So much for fame,\u201d the man shrugged, smiling wryly.  \u201cI am Symmachus, Milady Barenziah.  General Symmachus of His Awesome and Terrible Majesty Tiber Septim I's Imperial Army.  And I must say it's a merry chase you've led me throughout Tamriel.  Or this part of it, anyway.  Although I guessed, and guessed correctly, that you'd head for Morrowind eventually.  You had a bit of luck.  A body was found in Whiterun that was thought to be Straw's.  So we stopped looking for the pair of you.  That was careless of me.  Yet I'd not have thought you'd have stayed together this long.\u201d  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cWhere is he?  Is he all right?\u201d she asked in genuine trepidation.  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cOh, he's fine.  For now.  In custody, of course.\u201d  He turned away.  \u201cYou ... care for him, then?\u201d he said, and then suddenly stared at her with fierce curiosity.  Out of red eyes that seemed strange to her, except in her own seldom-seen reflection.  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cHe's my friend,\u201d Barenziah said.  The words came out in a tone that sounded dull and hopeless to her own ears.  Symmachus!  A general in the Imperial Army, no less--said to have the friendship and ears of Tiber Septim himself.  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cAi.  You seem to have several unsuitable friends--if you'll forgive my saying so, Milady.\u201d  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cStop calling me that.\u201d  She was irritated at the general's seeming sarcasm.  But he only smiled.  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAs they talked the bustle and flurry in the house died away.  Although she could still hear people, presumably the residents, whispering together not far off.  The tall Elf perched himself on a corner of the desk.  He seemed quite relaxed and prepared to stay awhile.  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThen it occurred to her.  Several unsuitable friends, had he said?  This man knew all about her!  Or seemed to know enough, anyway.  Which amounted to the same thing.  \u201cW-what's going to happen to them?  To m-me?\u201d  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cAh.  As you know, this house belongs to the commander of the Imperial troops in this area.  Which means to say that it belongs to me.\u201d  Barenziah gasped and Symmachus looked up sharply.  \u201cWhat, you didn't know?  Tsk, tsk.  Why, you are rash, Milady, even for seventeen.  You must always know what it is you do, or get yourself into.\u201d  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cB-but the G-guild w-wouldn't ... wouldn't h-have--\u201d  Barenziah was trembling.  The Thieves Guild would never have attempted a mission that crossed Imperial policy.  No one dared oppose Tiber Septim, at least no one she knew of.  Someone at the Guild had bungled.  Badly.  And now she was going to pay for it.  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cI daresay.  It's unlikely that Therris had Guild approval for this.  In fact, I wonder--\u201d  Symmachus examined the desk carefully, pulling out drawers.  He selected one, placed it on top of the desk, and removed a false bottom.  There was a folded sheet of parchment inside.  It seemed to be a map of some sort.  Barenziah edged closer.  Symmachus held it away from her, laughing.  \u201cRash indeed!\u201d  He glanced it over, then folded and replaced it.  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cYou advised me a moment ago to seek after knowledge.\u201d  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cSo I did, so I did.\u201d  Suddenly he seemed to be in high good humor.  \u201cWe must be going, my dear Lady.\u201d  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nHe shepherded her to the door, down the stairs, and out into the night air.  No one was about.  Barenziah's eyes darted toward the shadows.  She wondered if she could outrun him, or elude him somehow.  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cYou're not thinking of attempting to escape, are you?  Ai.  Don't you want to hear first what my plans for you are?\u201d  She thought that he sounded a bit hurt.  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cNow that you mention it--yes.\u201d  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cPerhaps you'd rather hear about your friends first.\u201d  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nHe looked gratified at this.  It was evidently the answer he wanted, thought Barenziah, but it was also the truth.  While she was concerned for her friends, especially Straw, she was far more concerned for herself.  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cYou will take your place as the rightful Queen of Mournhold.\u201d  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n***<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSymmachus explained that this had been his, and Tiber Septim's, plan for her all along.  That Mournhold, which had been under military rule for the dozen or so years since she had been away, was gradually to be returned to civilian government--under the Empire's guidance, of course, and as part of the Imperial Province of Morrowind.  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cBut why was I sent to Darkmoor?\u201d Barenziah asked, hardly believing anything she had just been told.  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cFor safekeeping, naturally.  Why did you run away?\u201d  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nBarenziah shrugged.  \u201cI saw no reason to stay.  I should have been told.\u201d  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cYou would have been by now.  I had in fact sent for you to be removed to the Imperial City to spend some time as part of the Emperor's household.  But of course you had, shall we say, absconded by then.  As for your destiny, it should be, and should have been, quite obvious to you.  Tiber Septim does not keep those he has no use for -- and what else could you be that would be of use to him?\u201d  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cI know nothing of him.  Nor, for that matter, of you.\u201d  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cThen know this:  Tiber Septim rewards friends and foes alike according to their deserts.\u201d  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nBarenziah chewed on that for a few moments.  \u201cStraw has deserved well of me and has never done anyone any harm.  He is not a member of the Thieves Guild.  He came along to protect me.  He earns our keep by running errands, and he ... he ...\u201d  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSymmachus waved her impatiently to silence.  \u201cAi.  I know all about Straw,\u201d he said, \u201cand about Therris.\u201d  He stared at her intently.  \u201cSo?  What would you?\u201d  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nShe took a deep breath.  \u201cStraw wants a little farm.  If I'm to be rich, then I would like for one to be given to him.\u201d  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cVery well.\u201d  He seemed astonished at this, and then pleased.  \u201cDone.  He shall have it.  And Therris?\u201d  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cHe betrayed me,\u201d Barenziah said coldly.  Therris should have told her what risks the job entailed.  Besides, he'd pushed her right into their enemies' arms in an attempt to save himself.  Not a man to be rewarded.  Not, in fact, a man to be trusted.  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cYes.  And?\u201d  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cWell, he should be made to suffer for it ... shouldn't he?\u201d  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cThat seems reasonable.  What form should said suffering take?\u201d  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nBarenziah balled her hands into fists.  She would've liked to beat and claw at the Khajiit herself.  But considering the turn events had taken, that didn't seem very queenly.  \u201cA whipping.  Er ... would twenty stripes be too many, do you think?  I don't want to do him any permanent injury, you understand.  Just teach him a lesson.\u201d  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cAi.  Of course.\u201d  Symmachus grinned at this.  Then his features suddenly set, and became serious.  \u201cIt shall be done, Your Highness, Milady Queen Barenziah of Mournhold.\u201d  Then he bowed to her, a sweeping, courtly, ridiculously wonderful bow.  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nBarenziah's heart leapt.  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n***<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nShe spent two days at Symmachus' apartment, during which she was kept very busy.  There was a Dark Elven woman named Drelliane who saw to her needs, although she did not exactly seem a servant since she took her meals with them.  Nor did she seem to be Symmachus' wife, or lover.  Drelliane looked amused when Barenziah asked her about it.  She simply said she was in the general's employ and did whatever was asked of her.  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nWith Drelliane's assistance, several fine gowns and pairs of shoes were ordered for her, plus a riding habit and boots, along with other small necessities.  Barenziah was given a room to herself.  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSymmachus was out a great deal.  She saw him at most mealtimes, but he said little about himself or what he had been doing.  He was cordial and polite, quite willing to converse on most subjects, and seemed interested in anything she had to say.  Drelliane was much the same.  Barenziah found them pleasant enough, but \u201chard to get to know,\u201d as Katisha would have put it.  She felt an odd twinge of disappointment.  These were the first Dark Elves with whom she'd associated closely.  She had expected to feel comfortable with them, to feel at last that she belonged somewhere, with somebody, as part of something.  Instead she found herself yearning for her Nordic friends, Katisha and Straw.  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nWhen Symmachus told her they were to set out for the Imperial City on the morrow, she asked if she could say good-bye to them.  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cKatisha?\u201d he asked.  \u201cAi.  But then ... I suppose I owe her something.  She it was who led me to you by telling me of a lonely Dark Elven girl named Berry who needed Elven friends -- and who sometimes dressed as a boy.  She has no association with the Thieves Guild, apparently.  And no one associated with the Thieves Guild seems to know your true identity, save Therris.  That is well.  I prefer that your former Guild membership not be made public knowledge.  Please speak of it to no one, Your Highness.  Such a past does not ... become an Imperial Queen.\u201d  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cNo one knows but Straw and Therris.  And they won't tell anyone.\u201d  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d  He smiled a curious little smile.  \u201cNo, they won't.\u201d  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nHe didn't know that Katisha knew, then.  But still, there was something about the way he said it ...  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nStraw came to their apartment on the morning of their departure.  They were left alone in the salon, although Barenziah knew that other Elves were within earshot.  He looked drawn and pale.  They hugged one another silently for a few minutes.  Straw's shoulders were shaking and tears were rolling down his cheeks, but he said nothing.  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nBarenziah tried a smile.  \u201cSo we both get what we want, eh?  I'm to be Queen of Mournhold and you'll be lord of your own farmstead.\u201d  She took his hand, smiled at him warmly, genuinely.  \u201cI'll write you, Straw.  I promise.  You must find a scribe so you can write me too.\u201d  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nStraw shook his head sadly.  When Barenziah persisted, he opened his mouth and pointed at it, making inarticulate noises.  Then she realized what it was.  His tongue was gone, had been cut off.  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nBarenziah collapsed onto a chair and wept noisily.  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n***<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cBut why?\u201d she demanded of Symmachus when Straw had been ushered away.  \u201cWhy?\u201d  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSymmachus shrugged.  \u201cHe knows too much.  He could be dangerous.  At least he's alive, and he won't need his tongue to ... raise pigs or whatever.\u201d  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cI hate you!\u201d Barenziah screamed at him, then abruptly doubled over and vomited on the floor.  She continued to revile him between intermittent bouts of nausea.  He listened stolidly for some time while Drelliane cleaned up after her.  Finally, he told her to cease or he would gag her for her journey to the Emperor.  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThey stopped at Katisha's house on their way out of the city.  Symmachus and Drelliane didn't dismount.  All seemed normal but Barenziah was frightened as she knocked on the door.  Katisha answered the knock.  Barenziah thanked the gods silently that at least she was all right.  But she'd also obviously been weeping.  In any case, she embraced Barenziah warmly.  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cWhy are you crying?\u201d Barenziah asked.  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cFor Therris, of course.  You haven't heard?  Oh dear.  Poor Therris.  He's dead.\u201d  Barenziah felt icy fingers creeping round her heart.  \u201cHe was caught stealing from the Commandant's house.  Poor fellow, but that was so foolish of him.  Oh, Berry, he was drawn and quartered this very dawn by the Commandant's order!\u201d  She started to sob.  \u201cI went.  He asked for me.  It was terrible.  He suffered so before he died.  I'll never forget it.  I looked for you and Straw, but no one knew where you'd both gone to.\u201d  She glanced behind Barenziah.  \u201cThat's the Commandant, isn't it?  Symmachus.\u201d  Then Katisha did a strange thing.  She stopped crying and grinned.  \u201cYou know, the moment I saw him, I thought, This is the one for Barenziah!\u201d  Katisha took a fold of her apron and wiped it across her eyes.  \u201cI told him about you, you know.\u201d  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d Barenziah said, \u201cI know.\u201d  She took Katisha's hands in each of hers and looked at her earnestly.  \u201cKatisha, I love you.  I'm going to miss you.  But please don't ever tell anyone else anything about me.  Ever.  Swear you won't.  Especially not to Symmachus.  And look after Straw for me.  Promise me that.\u201d  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nKatisha promised, puzzled though willing.  \u201cBerry, it wasn't somehow because of me that Therris was caught, was it?  I never said anything about Therris to ... to ... him.\u201d  She glanced over at the general.  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nBarenziah assured her that it wasn't, that an informant had told the Imperial Guard of Therris' plans.  Which was probably a lie, but she could see that Katisha plainly needed some kind of comfort.  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cOh, I'm glad of that, if I can be glad of anything just now.  I'd hate to think--  But how could I have known?\u201d  She leaned over and whispered in Barenziah's ear, \u201cSymmachus is very handsome, don't you think?  And so charming.\u201d  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cI wouldn't know about that,\u201d Barenziah said dryly.  \u201cI haven't really thought about it.  There've been other things to think about.\u201d  She explained hurriedly about being Queen of Mournhold and going to live in the Imperial City for a while.  \u201cHe was looking for me, that's all.  On orders from the Emperor.  I was the object of a quest, nothing more than some sort of... of a... goal.  I don't think he thinks of me as a woman at all.  He said I didn't look like a boy, though,\u201d she added in the face of Katisha's incredulity.  Katisha knew that Barenziah evaluated every male she met in terms of sexual desirability, and availability.  \u201cI suppose it's the shock of finding out that I really am a queen,\u201d she added, and Katisha agreed that yes, that's true, that must've been something of a shock, although one there was no likelihood of her experiencing firsthand.  She smiled.  Barenziah smiled with her.  Then they hugged again, tearfully, for the last time.  She never saw Katisha again.  Or Straw.  <BR>\r\nThe royal party left Rifton by the great southern gate.  Once through, Symmachus tapped her shoulder and pointed back at the portals.  \u201cI thought you might want to say good-bye to Therris too, Your Highness,\u201d he said.  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nBarenziah stared briefly but steadily at the head impaled on a spike above the gate.  The birds had been at it, but the face was still recognizable.  \u201cI don't think he'll hear me, although I'm quite sure he'll be pleased to know I'm fine,\u201d she said, seeming to sound light.  \u201cLet's be on our way, General, shall we?\u201d  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSymmachus was clearly disappointed by her lack of reaction.  \u201cAi.  You heard of this from your friend Katisha, I suppose?\u201d  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cYou suppose correctly.  She attended the execution,\u201d Barenziah said casually.  If he didn't know already, he'd find out soon enough, she was sure of that.  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cDid she know Therris belonged to the Guild?\u201d  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nShe shrugged.  \u201cEveryone knew that.  It's only lower-ranking members like me who are supposed to keep their membership secret.  The ones higher up are well known.\u201d  She turned to smile archly at him.  \u201cBut you must know all that, shouldn't you, General?\u201d she said sweetly.  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nHe seemed unaffected by this.  \u201cSo you told her who you were and whence you came, but not about the Guild.\u201d  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\u201cThe Guild membership was not my secret to tell.  The other was.  There's a difference.  Besides, Katisha is a very honest woman.  Had I told her, it would have lessened me in her eyes.  She was always after Therris to take up a more honest line of work.  I value her good opinion.\u201d  She afforded him a glacial stare.  \u201cNot that it's any concern of yours, but do you know what else she thought?  She also thought I'd be happier if I settled down with just one man.  One of my own race.  One of my own race with all the right qualities.  One of my own race with all the right qualities, who knows to say all the right things.  You, in fact.\u201d  She grabbed the reins preparatory to assuming a brisker pace--but not without sinking one final irresistible barb.  \u201cIsn't it odd how wishes come true sometimes--but not in the way you want them to?  Or maybe I should say, not in the way you would ever want them to?\u201d  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nHis answer so took her by surprise that she quite forgot about cantering off.  \u201cYes.  Very odd,\u201d he replied, and his tone matched his words exactly.  Then he excused himself and fell behind.  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nShe held her head high and urged her mount onward, trying to look unimpressed.  Now what was it about his response that bothered her?  Not what he said.  No, that wasn't it.  But something about the way he said it.  Something about it made her think that she, Barenziah, was one of his wishes that had come true.  Unlikely as this seemed, she gave it due deliberation.  He had found her at last, after months of searching, it seemed, under pressure from the Emperor, no doubt.  So his wish had come true.  Yes, that must be it.  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nBut in a way, apparently, not altogether to his liking.  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n",
